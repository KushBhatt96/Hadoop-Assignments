<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory	
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple	
A Herald.	
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;	
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.	
A Room in Leonato's house.	
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola	
A SENATOR'S house	
A SONG	
A Scottish Doctor	
A banquet.	
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted	
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:	
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-	
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting	
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease	
A churchyard.	
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,	
A comfort of retirement lives in this.	
A contract of true love; be not too late.	
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.	
A cunning man did calculate my birth	
A cup of wine, sir?	
A damned death!	
A dozen captains stay at door for you.	
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag	
A far more glorious star thy soul will make	
A father to me; and thou hast created	
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,	
A flourish of trumpets announces the play	
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady	
A forked mountain, or blue promontory	
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time	
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think	
A good digestion to you all; and once more	
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.	
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'	
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!	
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,	
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.	
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,	
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;	
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,	
A highway between Rome and Antium	
A hill near Alexandria	
A horse and a man	
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,	
A king!-perhaps-	
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit	
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal	
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.	
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.	
A little from this ground.	
A little herd of England's timorous deer,	
A little touch of Harry in the night.	
A little water clears us of this deed.	
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,	
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.	
A man at least, for less I should not be;	
A man of complements, whom right and wrong	
A man of such a feeble temper should	
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,	
A man well known throughout all Italy.	
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has	
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops	
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,	
A night is but small breath and little pause	
A nobler man, a braver warrior,	
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport	
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,	
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-	
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,	
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung	
A prison	
A prison.	
A private man in Athens. This for him.	
A public place.	
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't	
A retreat is sounded.	
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;	
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,	
A second Hector, for his grim aspect	
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world	
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,	
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh	
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,	
A street	
A street	
A street.	
A street.	
A sunny look of his would soon repair.	
A sure destruction.	
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,	
A thing more made of malice than of duty;	
A third thinks, without expense at all,	
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,	
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;	
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me	
A very valiant Briton and a good,	
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd	
A vulgar comment will be made of it,	
A warrant for his execution.	
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,	
A wife of such wood were felicity.	
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?	
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,	
A wretched creature and must bend his body	
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,	
A young Venetian, one that comes before	
AARON.  [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,	
AARON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.	
AARON. For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.	
AARON. Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.	
AARON. Lucius, save the child,	
AARON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.	
AARON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity	
AARON. Villain, I have done thy mother.	
AARON. Would you had hit it too!

ABERGAVENNY. I do know

ACHILLES. Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.	
ACHILLES. My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite	
ACHILLES. Now do I see thee, ha! Have at thee, Hector!	
ACHILLES. The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth

ACHILLES. What, am I poor of late?	
ACHILLES. Will you set your wit to a fool's?

ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.	
ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,	
ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.	
ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.	
ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.	
ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.	
ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.	
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;	
AEDILE. Very well.

AGAMEMNON. Good night.	
AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him.	
AGAMEMNON. No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,	
AGAMEMNON. O, no, you shall not go.	
AGAMEMNON. What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?	
AGAMEMNON. What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.	
AGAMEMNON. Where is Achilles?	
AGAMEMNON.Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one	
AGRIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.

ANGELO. 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,	
ANGELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,	
ANGELO. Believe me, on mine honour,	
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.	
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you	
ANGELO. From thee; even from thy virtue!	
ANGELO. Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why	
ANGELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good	
ANGELO. I did but smile till now.	
ANGELO. I will not do't.	
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.	
ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.	
ANGELO. Well; what's your suit?	
ANGELO. You make my bonds still greater.	
ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.	
ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.	
ANNE. How you do talk!	
ANNE. I fear me both are false.	
ANNE. I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?	
ANTONIO, his brother, the usurping Duke of Milan

ANTONIO. He misses not much.	
ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.	
ANTONIO. I Must obey. [To VIOLA] This comes with seeking you;	
ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,

ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-	
ANTONIO. I'll be thy second.      Exeunt SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO	
ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;	
ANTONIO. Then let us both be sudden.	
ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;	
ANTONIO. We two, my lord,	
ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;	
ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.	
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.	
ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-	
ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force	
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;	
ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.	
ANTONY. Hear me, queen:	
ANTONY. No further, sir.	
ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.	
ANTONY. Not so, not so;	
ANTONY. Now, Eros.	
ANTONY. The gods best know-	
ANTONY. Then let it do at once	
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,	
ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,	
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.	
ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes	
ANTONY. What's the matter?	
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.	
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?	
APEMANTUS. Canst not read?	
APEMANTUS. Dost hate a medlar?	
APEMANTUS. Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold	
APEMANTUS. No, I'll nothing; for if I should be brib'd too, there

About surrender up of Aquitaine

Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh	
Add to my clamours. Let us pay betimes	
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,	
Adieu,	
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle	
Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.	
Advance our standards, set upon our foes;	
Advertising and holy to your business,	
Affection is not rated from the heart;	
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd	
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.	
After new fancies. She dying gave it me,	
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear	
After the slaughter of so many peers,	
After the taste of much correction.	
Again, if any Syracusian born	
Against a change: woe is forerun with woe.	
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,	
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:	
Against the Capitol I met a lion,	
Against the French that met them in their bent,	
Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,	
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds	
Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,	
Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.	
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,	
Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!	
Ah! now no more will I control thy griefs.	
Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,	
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!	
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Troyan dead,	
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;	
Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see	
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,	
Alack, no remedy!- to the greedy touch	
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me	
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,	
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;	
Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD, bringing forth WARWICK, wounded	
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,	
Alarum.  Fight at sea.  Ordnance goes off.  Enter a LIEUTENANT,	
Alarum. Enter the KING and his train, with prisoners; EXETER, and others	
Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.	
Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;	
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.	
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-	
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?	
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.	
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,	
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business	
Alb. Great thing of us forgot!	
Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.	
Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.	
Alb. Where have you hid yourself?	
Albeit considerations infinite	
Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;	
Alengon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;	
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace	
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood	
All adoration, duty, and observance,	
All books of love, see that at any hand;	
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are	
All causes shall give way. I am in blood	
All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,	
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,	
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.	
All his in dedication; for his sake,	
All his offences live upon my head	
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,	
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,	
All may be well.                                  He kneels.	
All men make faults, and even I in this,	
All preparation for a bloody siege	
All several sins, all us'd in each degree,	
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-	
All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,	
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.          Exit	
All these the enemies to our poor bark.	
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,	
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,	
All will be nought else.	
Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,	
Allow their officers, and are content	
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name	
Already at my house.	
Already smokes about the burning crest	
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.	
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.	
Although particular, shall give a scantling	
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?	
Although the last, not least; to whose young love	
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;	
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.	
Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.	
Am bold to show myself a forward guest	
Am not I your Rosalind?	
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.	
Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight	
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,	
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered	
Amongst your cloven army.	
An Apothecary.	
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;	
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.	
An honour in him which buys out his fault-	
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;	
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.	
An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.	
An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,	
An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,	
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,	
And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,	
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;	
And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,	
And I am sent to be reveng'd on him.	
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.	
And I challenge law-attorneys are denied me;	
And I dare well maintain it with my life-	
And I did give't my husband.	
And I did never ask it you again;	
And I do hope good days and long to see.	
And I expressly am forbid to touch it;	
And I for sorrow sung,	
And I have heard it said unbidden guests	
And I myself see not the bottom of it.	
And I no friends to back my suit at all	
And I the matter will reword; which madness	
And I thus humble ever.	
And I will call hall to so strict account	
And I will give you audience.	
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	
And I will overhear their conference.	
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.	
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,	
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,	
And I, as sure as English Henry lives	
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us	
And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;	
And Nero will be tainted with remorse	
And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;	
And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it;	
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'	
And abstinence engenders maladies.	
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which	
And after summer evermore succeeds	
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;	
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes	
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.	
And all my followers to the eager foe	
And all my honest faith in thee is lost.	
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,	
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools	
And all out of an empty coffer;	
And all such false professors! Would you have me-	
And all th' unsettled humours of the land-	
And all that are assembled in this place	
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!	
And all things change them to the contrary.	
And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf	
And am right glad he is not standing here	
And an adopted name of privilege-	
And are you yet to your own souls so blind	
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore	
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!	
And as a stranger to my heart and me	
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,	
And as with age his body uglier grows,	
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.	
And at that time he got his wife with child.	
And at the other is my good friend Catesby;	
And at the pit of Acheron	
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy	
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,	
And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like	
And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice	
And be a carrion monster like thyself.	
And bears down all before him.	
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.	
And being once subdu'd in armed trail,	
And being seated, and domestic broils	
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-	
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush	
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.	
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,	
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee	
And bless the good remainders of the court!	
And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King.	
And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet	
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit	
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;	
And break your own neck down.	
And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,	
And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have	
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,	
And brought us thus together?	
And by me, had not our hap been bad.	
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,	
And by that music let us all embrace;	
And by that order of proscription.	
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,	
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear	
And cannot brook competitors in love?	
And cannot now accept. To grace him only,	
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,	
And choke your good to come. For his possessions,	
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.	
And come ye now to tell me John hath made	
And comes not in, overrul'd by prophecies-	
And confident from foreign purposes-	
And credulous to false prints.	
And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.	
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!	
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;	
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,	
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.	
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,	
And darts his light through every guilty hole,	
And deeper than oblivion do we bury	
And did upbraid me with my father's death;	
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!	
And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'	
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.	
And do such bitter business as the day	
And do you now cull out a holiday?	
And do you now put on your best attire?	
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,	
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?	
And down, down, adown-a, etc.	
And draw you into madness? Think of it.	
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	
And each (though enemies to either's reign)	
And earns a place i' th' story.	
And either end in peace- which God so frame!-	
And entertain'd me with mine own device;	
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs	
And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,	
And every godfather can give a name.	
And every lovely organ of her life	
And every tongue brings in a several tale,	
And fan our people cold.	
And farewell, friends;	
And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,	
And fell so roundly to a large confession	
And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,	
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent.	
And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.	
And fight and die is death destroying death,	
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;	
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms.	
And finds the testy gentleman so hot	
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,	
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.	
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods	
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,	
And follows but for form,	
And for a minister of my intent	
And for alliance sake, declare the cause	
And for her sake do I rear up her boy;	
And for his safety there I'll best devise.              Exit	
And for myself- foe as he was to me-	
And for they looked but with divining eyes,	
And for this sin there is no remedy,	
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish	
And forc'd to drink their vapour.	
And fortune led you well. You have the captives	
And foul imaginary eyes of blood	
And free my country from calamity	
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.	
And from his Holiness use all your power	
And future ages groan for this foul act;	
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,	
And get her leave to part. For not alone	
And give her as a prey to law and shame,	
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;	
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,	
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,	
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom	
And had he match'd according to his state,	
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,	
And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.	
And hath in his effect a voice potential	
And have a thousand times more cause than he	
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,	
And have the money by our father lent,	
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers	
And he shall feel mine edge.	
And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;	
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.            Exit	
And he whose wife is most obedient,	
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim	
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound	
And hear your mother's lamentation.	
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back	
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,	
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.                Exeunt	
And her quietus is to render thee.	
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge	
And here I swear by all the Roman gods-	
And here is not a creature but myself,	
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.	
And hold thee to my heart.	
And how desirous of our sight they are.	
And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,	
And how the English have the suburbs won.	
And how you find her.	
And hums, as who should say, "You'll rue the time	
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,	
And if I did but stir out of my bed,	
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him	
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,	
And if the rest be true which I have heard,	
And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,	
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.	
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;	
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget	
And if ye love me, as I think you do,	
And ill it doth beseem your holiness	
And in a vision full of majesty	
And in compassion weep the fire out;	
And in conclusion drove us to seek out	
And in her heart she scorns our poverty;	
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil	
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time	
And in the Capitol and Senate's right,	
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother	
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth	
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.	
And in the temple of great Jupiter	
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,	
And in this hand the other will I bear.	
And in this resolution here we leave you.	
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,	
And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus	
And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-	
And instantly return with me again	
And is not that your bondman Dromio?	
And it proceeds from policy, not love.	
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,	
And kept his credit with his purse;	
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;	
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;	
And know it now, the Senate have concluded	
And know us by these colours for thy foes	
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,	
And knows not how to do it but with tears.	
And laid his love and life under my foot;	
And lasting in her sad remembrance.	
And leads the will to desperate undertakings	
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows;	
And leave you naked.	
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.	
And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause	
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.	
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,	
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.	
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come	
And let ourselves again but understand	
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine	
And let the subject see, to make them know	
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,	
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs	
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.	
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,	
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,	
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	
And let us presently go sit in council,	
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	
And like her most whose merit most shall be;	
And like rich hangings in a homely house,	
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;	
And little is to do.	
And little recks to find the way to heaven	
And look upon my self and curse my fate,	
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,	
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,	
And made me almost yield upon my knees.	
And made me climb, With danger of my life.	
And made no deeper wounds? O flatt'ring glass,	
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.	
And maintain such a quarrel openly?	
And make a sop of all this solid globe;	
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine	
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,	
And makes him roar these accusations forth.	
And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,	
And many Jasons come in quest of her.	
And many strokes, though with a little axe,	
And mark how he continues.	
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:	
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?	
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.	
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;	
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.	
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!	
And more such days as these to us befall!             Exeunt	
And more, much more than in my verse can sit,	
And my ending is despair	
And my sick muse doth give an other place.	
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;	
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.	
And never did desire to see thee more.	
And never going aright, being a watch,	
And never live to show th' incredulous world	
And never noted in him any study,	
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,	
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	
And no conception nor no jealous toy	
And no man else hath honor by his death.	
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,	
And none of you will bid the winter come	
And none your foes but such as shall pretend	
And not Protector of the King or realm.	
And not a man of them shall have the grace,	
And not be check'd.	
And not of any challenge of desert,	
And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose	
And not the very King. I have two boys	
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!	
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	
And nothing of your answer.	
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-	
And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,	
And now both rivals, to mock Helena.	
And now he writes to heaven for his redress.	
And now in plainness do confess to thee,	
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.	
And now the matter grows to compromise	
And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.	
And now, to add more measure to your woes,	
And of the paste a coffin I will rear,	
And on just proof surmise, accumulate,	
And on our actions set the name of right	
And on to-morrow bid them march away.                 Exeunt	
And one man in his time plays many parts,	
And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.	
And our induction full of prosperous hope.	
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong	
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more	
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.	
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.	
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,	
And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,	
And pay the sum that may deliver me.	
And pen her up.	
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!	
And pity, like a naked new-born babe	
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.	
And plant in tyrants mild humility.	
And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.	
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?	
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,	
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;	
And pray thee take this mercy to provide	
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.	
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.	
And present execution of our wills	
And process of this time, you can report,	
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,	
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,	
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:	
And put it to the foil; but you, O you,	
And put your trial in the villain's mouth	
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge	
And ran dismayed away.	
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.	
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,	
And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!	
And rob me of a happy mother's name?	
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,	
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'	
And say you found them in mine honesty.	
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.	
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;	
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.	
And send them after to supply our wants;	
And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,	
And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines	
And set another up- should we survey	
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.	
And set upon our boasting enemy.	
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows	
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,	
And she alone is heir to both of us.	
And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,	
And she as much in love, her means much less	
And she is fair and, fairer than that word,	
And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies	
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.	
And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,	
And sight of men.	
And sin to break it.	
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,	
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;	
And six or seven winters more respect	
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.	
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention	
And slept above some fifteen year or more.	
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.	
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;	
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.	
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;	
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.	
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.	
And so she died. Had she been light, like you,	
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,	
And so, I pray you, tell him. Furthermore,	
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,	
And some donation freely to estate	
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;	
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.	
And soon to you, as you to me then tendered	
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.	
And stand upon my common part with those	
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.	
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,	
And strength by limping sway disabled	
And such a flood of greatness fell on you-	
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me	
And summ'd the account of chance before you said	
And sundry blessings hang about his throne	
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	
And ta'en, I fear.	
And take him from our presence.	
And take thy office from thee on my peril.	
And take upon command what help we have	
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.	
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,	
And tell him so; for I will else my heart,	
And tell him where I stay; give the like notice	
And tell me what thou notest about the field.	
And tempt us not to bear above our power!	
And that I have possess'd him my most stay	
And that a strange one too, which did awake me;	
And that my fortune runs against the bias.	
And that my path were even to the crown,	
And that no man might draw short breath to-day	
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world	
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-	
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite	
And that so lamely and unfashionable	
And that this body, consecrate to thee,	
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.	
And that your love taught it this alchemy?	
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him?	
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.	
And the country proverb known,	
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,	
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,	
And the premised flames of the last day	
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,	
And the remainder mourning over them,	
And the youth mistook by me	
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!	
And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,	
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit	
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines	
And then a mind put in't, either our brags	
And then away to Venice to your friend;	
And then he drew a dial from his poke,	
And then in post he came from Mantua	
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,	
And then your Highness shall command a peace.	
And there I stood amazed for a while,	
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith	
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;	
And therefore let me be thus bold with you	
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd	
And therefore take the present time,	
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,	
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover	
And thereof comes it that his head is light.	
And thereupon he sends you this good news,	
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.	
And these external manner of laments	
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?	
And these same thoughts people this little world,	
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.	
And they it were that ravished our sister.	
And they shall live, and he in them still green.	
And they thy glory through my grief will show.	
And think how such an apprehension	
And this is he that did the Tiger board	
And this shall free thee from this present shame,	
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;	
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,	
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;	
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.	
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;	
And thou, to be endeared to a king,	
And thou-	
And though I kill him not, I am the cause	
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand	
And thus I win thee.	
And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,	
And to defend ourselves it be a sin	
And to my fortunes and the people's favour	
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,	
And to survey his dead and earthy image,	
And to that place the sharp Athenian law	
And to that woman, when she has done most,	
And to the English court assemble now,	
And to the battle came he; where he did	
And to the last bended their light on me.	
And tread it under foot with all contempt,	
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.	
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.	
And twenty caged nightingales do sing.	
And undiscover'd come to me again	
And unsuspected court her by herself.	
And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,	
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear	
And we alive that liv'd? Fly, damned baseness,	
And we are for the dark.	
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;	
And we cast away moan.	
And we did think it writ down in our duty	
And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe	
And we shall have more wars befor't be long.	
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,	
And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice	
And what I want it boots not to complain.	
And what does else want credit, come to me,	
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.	
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,	
And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,	
And when I told thee he was of my counsel	
And when came George from Burgundy to England?	
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,	
And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,	
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open	
And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt	
And when the morning sun shall raise his car	
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,	
And where this breach now in our fortunes made	
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,	
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,	
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,	
And widow to Prince Arthur.	
And will maintain what thou hast said is false	
And will not be uplifted. But remember-	
And will not lightly trust the messenger.	
And will not promise her to any man	
And will not trust one of her malice with	
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,	
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly	
And will with all expedience charge on us.	
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.	
And winking Mary-buds begin	
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.	
And with a green and yellow melancholy	
And with a low submissive reverence	
And with affection wondrous sensible	
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,	
And with her breath she did perfume the air;	
And with him there lie mudded.                          Exit	
And with his arms out-stretch'd, as he would fly,	
And with indented glides did slip away	
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,	
And with some other business put the King	
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars	
And with this hateful liquor temper it;	
And with this knife I'll help it presently.	
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club	
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,	
And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd	
And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league	
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up	
And woes by wrong imaginations lose	
And woo your own destruction.	
And would afford my speechless vizard half.	
And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,	
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!	
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye.	
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,	
And y'are welcome all.	
And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,	
And yet I must remember you, my lord,	
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.	
And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,	
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.	
And yet not so; since I am sure my love's	
And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,	
And yet we hear no tidings from the King;	
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.	
And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,	
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.	
And yet, in substance and authority,	
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.	
And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,	
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,	
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.	
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.	
And you too, Somerset and Montague,	
And you will rather show our general louts	
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him? Will you needs be	
And you, my lords- methinks you do not well	
And your good Graces both have well proceeded	
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,	
And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!	
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.	
And, Captain, you must needs be friends with him.	
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,	
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see	
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.	
And, after all this fearful homage done,	
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,	
And, as the jest did glance away from me,	
And, as the president of my kingdom, will	
And, as you answer, I do know the scope	
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,	
And, dying, mention it within their wills,	
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.	
And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember	
And, good my lord, so please you let our trains	
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,	
And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,	
And, in a word, but even now worth this,	
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt	
And, in your power, soft silencing your son.	
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,	
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,	
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,	
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you:	
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath	
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.	
And, out of question, so it is sometimes:	
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee	
And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,	
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.	
And, to deal plainly,	
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.	
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him	
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,	
And, will they take the offer of our grace,	
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.	
And- God consigning to my good intents-	
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!	
Anne's mind as well as another does. Out upon 't, what	
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.     Exit a SERVINGMAN	
Anon do meet the Senate.	
Another of his fathom they have none	
Another part of the field.	
Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.	
Another ring, that what in time proceeds	
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,	
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;	
Answering before we do demand of them.	
Ant. This same is she, and I do give you her.	
Ant. [to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul'd by your	
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.	
Any thing in or out of our demands;	
Anything on him; for he hath a witchcraft	
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;	
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,	
Are all unfolded; wherein he appears	
Are brought to the correction of your law.	
Are but black to Rosalinde.	
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;	
Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast	
Are gone, are gone;	
Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies	
Are level now with men. The odds is gone,	
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.	
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,	
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,	
Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?	
Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner?	
Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;	
Are of consent and sufferance in this.	
Are of two houses: lawful mercy	
Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill	
Are richly come to harbour suddenly.	
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd	
Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?	
Are they return'd?	
Are they that I would have thee deal upon.	
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,	
Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?	
Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should	
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-	
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?	
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.	
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;	
Arrest them to the answer of the law;	
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing	
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece	
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,	
As I am a true spirit, welcome!           [A noise of horns]	
As I can bid thee speak.	
As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount	
As I do live by food, I met a fool,	
As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.	
As I intend to thrive in this new world,	
As I requir'd; and wot you what I found	
As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour	
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,	
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,	
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-	
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set	
As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,	
As are companions noted and most known	
As badness would desire.	
As banks of Libya-though, Apollo knows,	
As by discharge of their artillery	
As by your Grace shall be propounded him	
As cherry is to cherry.	
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone	
As every loyal subject ought to do.	
As far as land will let me by your side.	
As far as toucheth my particular,	
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-	
As fitting best to quittance their deceit,	
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint	
As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness;	
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.	
As frowning at the favours of the world?	
As gentle tell me of what honour was	
As gifts to Desdemona;	
As good as we?	
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.	
As great Sicilius' heir.	
As great as that thou fear'st.	
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,	
As haggards of the rock.	
As harbingers preceding still the fates	
As he that sleeps here swims.	
As he will have me, how am I so poor?	
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,	
As his strong sides can volley.	
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us	
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.	
As huge as high Olympus.	
As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder	
As if they came from several citizens,	
As if they saw some wondrous monument,	
As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury.	
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain	
As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,	
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it	
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.	
As it doth well appear unto our state,	
As it is common for the younger sort	
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.	
As level as the cannon to his blank,	
As long as you or I; yet he must die.	
As loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear	
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,	
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,	
As matter whole you have not to make it with,	
As may beseem a monarch like himself.	
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.	
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,	
As much as would maintain, to the King's honour,	
As much good stay with thee as go with me!	
As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks	
As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,	
As often as I guess'd.	
As on a mountain-top the cedar shows,	
As on a pillory, looking through the lute,	
As seal to this indenture of my love:	
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,	
As soul and body's severing.	
As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt	
As surfeit is the father of much fast,	
As the remembrance of an idle gaud	
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,	
As the weird women promised, and I fear	
As then the messenger-	
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,	
As therefore kept to do so.	
As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,	
As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:	
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time	
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.	
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote	
As to expend your time with us awhile	
As to my ample hope was promised	
As to prevent our maladies unseen,	
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,	
As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.	
As very infants prattle of thy pride.	
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar	
As well assur'd Richard their King is dead.             Exit	
As well my undertakings as your counsels;	
As when his virtues shining upon others	
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,	
As wit turn'd fool; folly, in wisdom hatch'd,	
As with a saint.	
As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,	
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.	
As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.	
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,	
As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit	
As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business	
As, if it can, I will presume in you-	
As, liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,	
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got	
Assays to lead the way. If I once stir,	
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.	
Assured bondage?'	
Assured loss before the match be play'd.	
At any time to grace my stratagems.	
At duty, more than I could frame employment;	
At eighteen years became inquisitive	
At every joint and motive of her body.	
At least from fair five hundred pound a year.	
At least in my opinion.	
At market-price have bought.	
At no time broke my faith, would not betray	
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book;	
At such who not born fair no beauty lack,	
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,	
At what it did so freely? From this time	
At whose approach ghosts, wand'ring here and there,	
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,	
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.	
Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit,	
Attendants on Theseus and Hippolyta	
Audacious cruelty. If that the King	
Augustus lives to think on't; and so much	
Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'	
Authority so weighty.	
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,	
Awake.	
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties	
Away from light steals home my heavy son	
Away from me, and let me hear no more!	
Away to heaven respective lenity,	
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight;	
Away with Slender, and with him at Eton	
Away! vexation almost stops my breath,	
Away, and for our flight.	
Away, my disposition, and possess me	
Away, my lord, away!                                  Exeunt	
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.	
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,	
BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.	
BANQUO. All's well.	
BANQUO. New honors come upon him,	
BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles as the water has,	
BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?	
BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.	
BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	
BANQUO. [Within.] Give us a light there, ho!	
BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa. By report	
BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,	
BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended?	
BAPTISTA. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,	
BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!	
BAPTISTA. When will he be here?	
BARDOLPH. Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.	
BARDOLPH. Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]	
BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside.	
BARDOLPH. My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain, Sir	
BARDOLPH. O joyful day!	
BARDOLPH. Yea, my lord.	
BASSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.	
BASSANIO. Gratiano!	
BASSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is.	
BASSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words;	
BASSANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves;	
BASSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,	
BASSET. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.	
BASSIANUS. Lavinia, how say you?	
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	
BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.	
BASTARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.	
BASTARD. I know not why, except to get the land.	
BASTARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?	
BASTARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.	
BASTARD. Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;	
BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe,	
BASTARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,	
BASTARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:	
BASTARD. Search out thy wit for secret policies,	
BASTARD. Some bastards too.	
BASTARD. Will't not be?	
BEDFORD. Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!	
BEDFORD. Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,	
BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten	
BELARIUS. I fear'twill be reveng'd.	
BELARIUS. Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.	
BELARIUS. This is he,	
BELARIUS. Those runagates?	
BERKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.	
BEROWNE. 'Did they?' quoth you. Who sees the heavenly Rosaline	
BEROWNE. A death's face in a ring.	
BEROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord.	
BEROWNE. An thou wert a lion we would do so.	
BEROWNE. By earth, she is not, corporal: there you lie.	
BEROWNE. I would you heard it groan.	
BEROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.	
BEROWNE. Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her	
BEROWNE. There is five in the first show.	
BEROWNE. What reason have you for 't?	
BEROWNE. What, are there but three?	
BEROWNE. Why ask you?	
BEROWNE. Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain	
BEROWNE. [Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of

BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.	
BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;	
BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,	
BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?	
BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.	
BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.	
BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know	
BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.	
BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent.

BLUNT, and others	
BOATSWAIN	
BOATSWAIN. None that I more love than myself. You are	
BOLINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.	
BOLINGBROKE. Joy absent, grief is present for that time.	
BOLINGBROKE. Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,	
BOLINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.	
BOLINGBROKE. O, who can hold a fire in his hand	
BOLINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.	
BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.	
BOLINGBROKE. They love not poison that do poison need,	
BOLINGBROKE. Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;	
BOLINGBROKE. To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.	
BOLINGBROKE. Whither?	
BOLINGBROKE. Yet ask.	
BONA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd	
BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell.             Exeunt citizens	
BOTH. Do we, my lord?	
BOTTOM. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then	
BOTTOM. I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out	
BOTTOM. I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and

BOTTOM. We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and

BOURBON. Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!	
BOY. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,	
BOYET. But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?	
BOYET. But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;	
BOYET. Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.	
BOYET. Good sir, be not offended;	
BOYET. I am bound to serve.	
BOYET. Navarre had notice of your fair approach,	
BOYET. The pommel of Coesar's falchion.	
BOYET. What, then; do you see?	
BOYET. [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot.	
BRABANTIO.                  God be with you! I have done.	
BRABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;	
BRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.	
BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!	
BRABANTIO. So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:	
BRITAINE. They bid us to the English dancing-schools	
BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,	
BRUTUS. Ay, saw you anything?	
BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.	
BRUTUS. By your pardon,	
BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.	
BRUTUS. Go about it.                               Exit AEDILE	
BRUTUS. Hark, he is arrived.	
BRUTUS. He consul!	
BRUTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,	
BRUTUS. He is welcome too.	
BRUTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.	
BRUTUS. I would he had.	
BRUTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.	
BRUTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.	
BRUTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.	
BRUTUS. No.	
BRUTUS. Not Possible.	
BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!	
BRUTUS. So it must fall out	
BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,	
BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,	
BRUTUS. Titinius' face is upward.	
BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.	
BRUTUS. We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?	
BRUTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?	
BRUTUS. Which the rather	
BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?	
BRUTUS. You did.	
BRUTUS. Your reason?	
BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!	
BUCKINGHAM. My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth	
BUCKINGHAM. My lord-	
BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,	
BUCKINGHAM. O, you go far!	
BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!	
BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;	
BUCKINGHAM. This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I	
BUCKINGHAM. True, madam, none at all. What can you this?	
BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,	
BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?	
BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die	
BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please	
BULLCALF. O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.	
BURGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.	
BURGUNDY. Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy	
BUSHY - favourites of King Richard	
BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.	
BUSHY. Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,	
BUSHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.	
BUSHY. Well, we may meet again.	
BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.	
BUSHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland	
Bal. Full half an hour.	
Bald. This bottle makes an angel.	
Balth. No more words. The clerk is answered.	
Barnardine!	
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.	
Bassanio presently will go aboard;	
Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,	
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,	
Be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue,	
Be cross'd with slowness! Labour be his meed!           Exit	
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,	
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath	
Be hang'd up for example at their doors.	
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more	
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about	
Be here presented. Now we bear the King	
Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?	
Be look'd upon and learnt; which once attain'd,	
Be not as extreme in submission as in offence;	
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.	
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace	
Be now produc'd and heard.	
Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!	
Be soon collected, and all things thought upon	
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.	
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;	
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.	
Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;	
Be you rememb'red, Marcus; she's gone, she's fled.	
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did	
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.	
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.	
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.	
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.	
Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled;	
Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly?	
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,	
Beat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,	
Beat. 'Then' is spoken. Fare you well now. And yet, ere I go, let	
Beat. And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?	
Beat. As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for

Beat. O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!	
Beat. They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.	
Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,	
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconbridge,	
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.	
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.	
Because in York this breeds suspicion;	
Because some tell me that thou art a king.	
Because that I am little, like an ape,	
Because you are not of our quality,	
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?	
Become them with one half so good a grace	
Becomes a sun, and makes your son a shadow.	
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon	
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend	
Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,	
Beetles black, approach not near;	
Before Harfleur	
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:	
Before I positively speak in this.	
Before a true and lawful magistrate	
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!	
Before he'll buy again at such a rate.	
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet	
Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue	
Begins his golden progress in the East.	
Begone, I say,	
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,	
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect	
Being all descended to the labouring heart,	
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,	
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.	
Being but the one half of an entire sum	
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	
Being no further enemy to you	
Belief of it oppresses me already.	
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.               Exit PISTOL	
Believe not all; or if you must believe,	
Belike some noble gentleman that means,	
Belike you thought our love would last too long,

Ben. Strike, drum.

Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,	
Bene. And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.	
Bene. Beat--	
Bene. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.	
Bene. Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.'	
Bene. In every good thing.	
Bene. In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come	
Bene. Is there any way to show such friendship?	
Bene. Not now.	
Bene. O God, sir, here's a dish I love not! I cannot endure my Lady	
Bene. Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it	
Bene. Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.	
Bene. Two of them have the very bent of honour;	
Bene. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.	
Bene. Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?	
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,	
Benedick, Hero, Beatrice, [and Attendants].	
Benedick.	
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?	
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?	
Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.	
Ber. Long live the King!	
Ber. Say-	
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!	
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,	
Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,	
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-	
Besides this present instance of his rage,	
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;	
Bestow your counsels on me; she now begs	
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,	
Better consider what you have to do	
Between compulsion and a brave respect!	
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,	
Between the elements of air and earth	
Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,	
Between you I shall have a holy head.	
Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,	
Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,	
Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd	
Bitter to me as death; your life, good master,	
Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,	
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,	
Bora. Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.	
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,	
Born out of your dominions, having here	
Both fill'd and running- ravening first the lamb,	
Both for your honour better and your cause;	
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.	
Both in his private conscience and his place,	
Both now and ever bless her! 'Tis a girl,	
Boy. Signior?	
Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!	
Break with your wives of your departure hence.	
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.	
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art thou alive,	
Brim full of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly	
Bring her to try wi' th' maincourse.  [A cry within]  A	
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;	
Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.	
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;	
Brook, that you have cozen'd of money, to whom you	
Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.	
Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,	
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience	
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?	
Burn house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be	
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,	
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.	
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,	
But I did find him still mine enemy.	
But I must also feel it as a man.	
But I shall in a more continuate time	
But I should think of shallows and of flats,	
But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,	
But Margaret was in some fault for this,	
But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevail'd.	
But Romeo may not- he is banished.	
But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,	
But age with his stealing steps	
But all hoods make not monks.	
But all in vain are these mean obsequies;	
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,	
But all's not done- yet keep the French the field.	
But an unkind self, that itself will leave	
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;	
But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,	
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	
But beggary and poor looks.	
But by his mother was perforce withheld.	
But by immortal Providence she's mine.	
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!	
But by your setting on, by your consent?	
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.	
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.	
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device	
But do it when the next thing he espies	
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,	
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,	
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.        Exeunt	
But edifies another with her deeds.              Exeunt severally	
But fearing since how it might work, hath sent	
But few now living can behold that goodness-	
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;	
But for my lord your son-	
But for thy world enjoying but this land,	
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,	
But from the inward motion to deliver	
But give them to his master for a present.	
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these	
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.	
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly	
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,	
But he, his own affections' counsellor,	
But heaviness foreruns the good event.	
But him outlive, and die a violent death.	
But howsoever strange and admirable.	
But if I tell how these two did coact,	
But if the gods themselves did see her then,	
But if thou live remembered not to be,	
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,	
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,	
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,	
But if you would consider the true cause	
But if your father had been victor there,	
But if your title to the crown be weak,	
But in a dream of friendship,	
But in all places else your master Lucentio.	
But in mine emulous honour let him die	
But keep a farm and carters.	
But kill not all together.	
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!	
But know I think, and think I know most sure,	
But know not how to do it.	
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,	
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.	
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;	
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.	
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone	
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,	
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage	
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,	
But little for my profit; can you think, lords,	
But long I will not be Jack out of office.	
But love is blind, and lovers cannot see	
But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.	
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,	
But make amends now. Get you gone,	
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious	
But me and mine; how happy art thou then	
But men may construe things after their fashion,	
But mice and rats, and such small deer,	
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,	
But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,	
But more of that anon. Take him aside.	
But more than these, in love I do deserve.	
But my kisses bring again, bring again;	
But never more be officer of mine.	
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency	
But note me, signior.	
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in	
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,	
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.	
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.	
But now two paces of the vilest earth	
But one imperious in another's throne?	
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly	
But penetrable to your kind entreaties,	
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.	
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;	
But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents	
But room, fairy, here comes Oberon.	
But say, again, how many saw the child?	
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out	
But see! while idly I stood looking on,	
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;	
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine	
But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,	
But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-	
But sorrow flouted at is double death.	
But stand against us like an enemy.	
But straight they told me they would bind me here	
But such as I, without your special pardon,	
But such is the infection of the time	
But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?	
But that is in my thought, whose love to you	
But that my master rather play'd than fought,	
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.	
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,	
But that so much of earth and water wrought,	
But that the heavens fought. The King himself	
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,	
But the defendant doth that plea deny,	
But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,	
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,	
But thence I learn and find the lesson true,	
But they can see a sort of traitors here.	
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.	
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.	
But thither would I hie.	
But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd,	
But thoughts the slave, of life, and life time's fool,	
But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.	
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.	
But to defend his person from night-foes?	
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.	
But to recover of us, by strong hand	
But took me in my throes,	
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest.	
But we in silence hold this virtue well:	
But we will presently provide for them.	
But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,	
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.	
But welcome as you are. What shall we do?	
But were my worth as is my conscience firm,	
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell	
But what said Warwick to these injuries?	
But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.	
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight	
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?	
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,	
But when he frown'd, it was against the French	
But when he once attains the upmost round,	
But when her humorous ladyship is by	
But when you are well pleas'd.	
But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?	
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?	
But who comes here?	
But who comes here? I am invisible;	
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!	
But who?	
But win the noble Brutus to our party-	
But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,	
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes	
But words are words; I never yet did hear	
But yet I'll bury thee. Thou't go, strong thief,	
But, as I think, it was by th' Cardinal;	
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,	
But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery	
But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:	
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,	
But, let them measure us by what they will,	
But, like the owner of a foul disease,	
But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,	
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,	
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,	
But, sure, he is stark mad.	
But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,	
But. Tut! I came not to hear this.

By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,	
By Him that made us all, I am resolv'd

By all your good leaves, gentlemen, here I'll make	
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:	
By day's approach look to be visited.	
By duty ruminated.	
By each at once her choppy finger laying	
By false accuse doth level at my life.	
By giving love, your sorrow and my grief	
By help of her more potent ministers,

By him imprinted, and within his power	
By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery!	
By law of nature and of nations, 'longs	
By losing of our prayers.	
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever	
By my so potent art. But this rough magic	
By nature made for murders and for rapes.	
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,	
By our proceeding in hostility;	
By self-example mayst thou be denied.	
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.	
By so receiving a dishonour'd life	
By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth	
By that and all the rites of knighthood else	
By that false woman as this king by thee.	
By that same god- what god soe'er it be	
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,	
By the imprisoning of unruly wind	
By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous	
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up	
By thee was punched full of deadly holes.	
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must

By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.

COSTARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.	
COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;

COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.	
COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?	
COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport	
COUNTESS. This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;

CRESSIDA. But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her	
CRESSIDA. Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.	
CRESSIDA. In faith, I will, lo; never trust me else.

Can alter a decree established;	
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;	
Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.	
Can hide you from our messengers of war,	
Can you still dream, and pore, and thereon look?	
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;	
Cannot attain it, why then-hark you hither.	
Cannot be cur'd by words; therefore be still.	
Cannot conceive nor name thee.	
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.	
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-lacks!

Claud. For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.	
Claud. How sweetly you do minister to love,

Claud. If he dote on her upon this, I will never trust my

Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.	
Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground?	
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he	
Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,	
Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these presence, even	
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;	
Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow-	
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!	
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;	
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;	
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;	
Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,	
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,	
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time	
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.	
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,	
Dennis!	
Depart again. Here, here will I remain	
Description cannot suit itself in words	
Deserv'd this hearing. Bid 'em send o' th' instant

Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may	
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;	
Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!	
Destroyed in such a shape.	
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.	
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?	
Dewlapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em	
Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece?	
Did I offend your Highness.	
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man	
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands	
Did gibe my missive out of audience.	
Did he not say my brother was fled?	
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt	
Did share it.	
Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end	
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but	
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;	
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him-	
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!	
Die single and thine image dies with thee.	
Die; perish. Might but my bending down	
Discredit more in hiding of the fault	
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel,	
Disguise us at my lodging, and return	
Dismissing half your train, come then to me.	
Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny,	
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.	
Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them	
Dispute not that; York is the worthier.	
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!	
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.	
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;	
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.	
Divide your happy England into four;	
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,	
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.	
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart;	
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,	
Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market	
Do draw the inward quality after them,	
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor	
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;	
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.	
Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-	
Do not call it sin in me	
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me!	
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more,	
Do paint the meadows with delight,	
Do shameful execution on herself.	
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right	
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.	
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?	
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,

Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep	
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,	
Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place

Even by your own.	
Even for the service that long since I did thee,	
Even for this, let us divided live,

Even in his garments, and did give himself,

Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

Even in their throats that have committed them.	
Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!	
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram	
Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;	
Even this repays me.	
Even to his inches, and, with private soul,	
Even with the vail and dark'ning of the sun,	
Ever shall in safety rest.	
Every one lets forth his sprite,	
Every thing that heard him play,	
Examine every married lineament,	
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,	
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;	
Except some petty towns of no import.	
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.

Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd	
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:	
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!	
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;	
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.	
For England.	
For France, for France, for it is more than need.	
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,	
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated.	
For God's sake, send some other messenger.	
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.	
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.	
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,	
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,	
For I must now to Oberon.                      Exit	
For I must use thee.	
For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit	
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,	
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.	
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;	
For Rome, towards Marcius.	
For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.	
For Warwick is a subtle orator,	
For all the day they view things unrespected,	
For amplest credence.	
For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!	
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,	
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.	
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;	
For but a month ago I went from hence,	
For ere the glass that now begins to run	
For ev'ry word. He is so kind that he now	
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.	
For even to vice	
For ever and for ever shall be yours.	
For ever the society of men.	
For every man hath business and desire,	
For fear lest day should look their shames upon;	
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-	
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,	
For had the passions of thy heart burst out,	
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great	
For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.	
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,	
For he, to-night, shall lie with Mistress Ford.       Exeunt	
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter	
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes	
For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute	
For his advantage that I dearly love.	
For his divisions, as the times do brawl,	
For how can tyrants safely govern home	
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,	
For if he be not one that truly loves you,	
For insurrection's arguing.	
For it is parting from us.	
For loving where you do; but if yourself,	
For me, most wretched, to perform the like.	
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,	
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.	
For more than blushing comes to. If your back	
For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak	
For my example.	
For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.	
For never two such kingdoms did contend	
For never was a story of more woe	
For not bestowing on him at his asking	
For nothing but his Majesty's approach.	
For now I stand as one upon a rock,	
For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:	
For now our observation is perform'd,	
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.	
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,	
For powers In Scotland; which, for divers reasons	
For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;	
For she will score your fault upon my pate.	
For sinking under them.	
For slander lives upon succession,	
For sluttish spoils of opportunity,	
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,	
For so your father charg'd me at our parting:	
For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.	
For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone-	
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason	
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.	
For such as I am all true lovers are,	
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him	
For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.	
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;	
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:	
For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty	
For the demand of our neglected tribute.	
For the four winds blow in from every coast	
For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,	
For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,	
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,	
For then I pity those I do not know,	
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	
For these domestic and particular broils	
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,	
For they breathe truth that breathe their words -in pain.	
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free	
For this contains our general grievances.	
For this immediate levy, he commands	
For this the foolish over-careful fathers	
For this was of much length- the vile conclusion	
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.	
For this, consorted with the citizens,	
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,	
For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.	
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,	
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.	
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,	
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,	
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,	
For we shall presently have need of you.	
For we were subjects but while you were king.	
For we would give much, to use violent thefts	
For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]	
For what advancement may I hope from thee,	
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?	
For what is in this world but grief and woe?	
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,	
For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly	
For which I would not plead, but that I must;	
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do	
For wise men say it is the wisest course.	
For womanish it is to be from thence.	
For you must know we have with special soul	
For you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay.	
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself	
For your physicians have expressly charg'd,	
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.	
For, though before his face I speak the words,	
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.	
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,	
Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:	
Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?	
Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice	
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,	
Form such another? This is the very top,	
Forslow no longer; make we hence amain.               Exeunt	
Fort. Let four captains	
Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to	
Fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with

Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.	
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,

Fraught with the ministers and instruments	
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,	
French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with	
Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;	
Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous	
Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,	
Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;	
Friar. O woeful sympathy!	
Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.	
Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.	
Friar. To do what, signior?	
Friar. Yea, wherefore should she not?	
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave	
From Claudio, and the Prince; but what's your will?	
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,	
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,	
From France to England, there to live in peace!	
From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place	
From east to occident; cry out for service;	
From fairies and the tempters of the night	
From false to false, among false maids in love,	
From firm security.	
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found	
From me do back receive the flour of all,	
From me, whose love was of that dignity	
From mine own library with volumes that	
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.	
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit	
From out the circle of his territories.	
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make	
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en	
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,	
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?	
From the great compt; but love that comes too late,	
From these devourers to be banished!	
From this bare wither'd trunk. Upon thy sight	
From what you rightly are.	
From where he circumscribed with his sword	
From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,	
Froward by nature, enemy to peace;	
Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor	
Full of protest, of oath, and big compare,	
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;	
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,	
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:

GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;

GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.	
GLOUCESTER. Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?	
GLOUCESTER. Madam, the King is old enough himself	
GLOUCESTER. Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again.	
GLOUCESTER. Presumptuous priest, this place commands my

GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.	
GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.	
Hath from the number of his banish'd years	
Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,	
Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took	
Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead;	
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else	
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof	
Hath left a witness'd usurpation.	
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.	
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.	
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,	
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.	
Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,	
Hath set the women on to this complaint.	
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already.	
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.	
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,	
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,	
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;	
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,	
Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts

Have been deceived; for they swore you did.	
Have earnestly implor'd a general peace	
Have ever come too short of my desires,	
Have fought with equal fortune, and continue	
Have hent the gates, and very near upon	
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.	
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.	
Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship	
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick	
Have made themselves so strong- for with her death	
Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?	
Have more, or else unsay't; and now, while 'tis hot,	
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,	
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.	
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?	
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans	
Have we no wine here?	
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter

Have you delivered to her our decree?

He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks	
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,	
He being of age to govern of himself?	
He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King;	
He calls me to a restitution large	
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber	
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;	
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,	
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,	
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times	
He did it with a serious mind; a heed	
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines	
He first presents his fire, and the high east	
He hath and is again to cope your wife.	
He hath but as offended in a dream!	
He hath good usage and great liberty;	
He hath got his friend with child.	
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message	
He heard the name of death.                 [A noise within]	
He held them sixpence all too dear,	
He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?	
He is a man. I'll love him as my brother;	
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.	
He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it	
He is the half part of a blessed man,	
He is wit's pedlar, and retails his wares	
He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys	
He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?	
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear	
He makes me angry with him; for he seems	
He merits well to have her that doth seek her,	
He might return to vasty Tartar back,	
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,	
He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;	
He presently, as greatness knows itself,	
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.	
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,	
He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!	
He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,	
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:	
He sends you not to murder me for this,	
He shall again relate.	
He shall live a man forbid.	
He shall unbolt the gates.	
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;	
He still hath held them; that to's power he would	
He takes false shadows for true substances.	
He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.	
He that brings this love to the	
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;	
He that sweetest rose will find	
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,	
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,	
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.	
He took my father grossly, full of bread,	
He us'd as creatures of another place;	
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;	
He was quick mettle when he went to school.	
He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?	
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.	
He would himself have been a soldier.	
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.              [Kisses her]	
He'll shape his old course in a country new.	
He's a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece	
He's strange and peevish.	
He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy.	
He, but a Duke, would have his son a king,	
He, he, and you- and you, my liege!- and I	
He- to give fear to use and liberty,	
Hear but my name, and tremble.	
Hear from me still, and never of me aught	
Hear me with patience.	
Hear nothing from him.	
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts	
Heigh-ho! sing, &c.	
Heir to the crown?	
Help, help, ho!	
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,	
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,	
Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;	
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,	
Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,	
Her injury the beadle to her sin;	
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,	
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,	
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,	
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.	
Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.

Here comes Navarre.	
Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,	
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up	
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd	
Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.	
Here is some gold for thee.	
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth	
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'	
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy,	
Here shall he see	
Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.	
Here sits a king more woeful than you are.	
Here the Lady sings a Welsh song.	
Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed,	
Here they rob and bind them. Exeunt.	
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,	
Here's Rome's young Captain, let him tell the tale;	
Here's many else have done, you shout me forth	
Here's no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt,	
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,	
Here's to thy health.	
Here's-	
Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;	
Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?	
Hero. And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?	
Hero. God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy.	
Hero. Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise.	
Hero. Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune?	
Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a	
Herself most chastely absent. After this,	
Hide it in smiles and affability;	
Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words;	
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;	
Highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not	
Him in thy course untainted do allow,	
Him, and his innocent child; for which foul deed	
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom	
Hir'd to it by your brother.	
His Highness having liv'd so long with her, and she	
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,	
His body will I bear unto the King.	
His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in;	
His breeches cost him but a crown;	
His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.	
His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,	
His champions are the prophets and apostles;	
His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.	
His deeds with doing them, and is content	
His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;	
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,	
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,	
His guard have brought him thither.	
His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself	
His heart and hand both open and both free;	
His honour and the greatness of his name	
His insolence can brook to be commanded	
His liberal eye doth give to every one,	
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.	
His mansion, and his titles, in a place	
His measure duly.	
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,	
His name and credit shall you undertake,	
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave	
His pardon for return.	
His perishing root with the increasing vine!	
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,	
His silver skin laced with his golden blood,	
His soul and body to their lasting rest.	
His sovereign's life to death and treachery!	
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.	
His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck	
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;	
His valour shown upon our crests today	
His wit set down to make his valour live.	
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide	
Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,	
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,	
Holla the other.	
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.	
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;	
Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.	
Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,	
Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,	
Hor. Let them come in.	
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	
Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.	
Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave	
Hor. There's no offence, my lord.	
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.	
Hor. What news, my lord?	
Hor. What's that, my lord?	
Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent	
Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He	
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.	
Host. No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir	
Host. Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?	
Hot. An if the devil come and roar for them,	
Hot. And I say the earth was not of my mind,	
Hot. But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then	
Hot. He does, he does! We'll be reveng'd on him.	
Hot. I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,	
Hot. If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!	
Hot. No.	
Hot. Not yours, in good sooth? Heart! you swear like a	
Hot. Of York, is it not?	
Hot. This, Douglas? No. I know this face full well.	
Hot. Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short	
Hot. What, ho!	
Hot. Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick	
How a score of ewes now?	
How all occasions do inform against me	
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!	
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,	
How deep you were within the books of God?	
How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me	
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?	
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?	
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands	
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs	
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?	
How full of valour did he bear himself	
How goes the field?	
How goes the world, sir, now?	
How happy then were my ensuing death!	
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex	
How like the prodigal doth she return,	
How long continued; and what stock he springs of-	
How many be commanded that command!	
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false	
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail	
How might a prince of my great hopes forget	
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;	
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned	
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	
How much the quantity, the weight as much	
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal	
How now! What news?	
How now! What's the matter?	
How now! what news?	
How now, Cassio!	
How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you enquir'd yet who pick'd	
How now, Malvolio!	
How now, Pistol?	
How now, what noise! That spirit's possess'd with haste	
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,	
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-	
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?	
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts	
How say you, my lord, are you not content?	
How shall we then behold their natural tears?	
How shall we then dispense with that contract,	
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is	
How should I your true-love know	
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,	
How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,	
How swift his ship.	
How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry	
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;	
How true a gentleman you send relief,	
How we may steal from hence; and for the gap	
How well resembles it the prime of youth,	
How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!	
How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world?	
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,	
Humbly call'd mistress.	
Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive	
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;	
Hung their heads and then lay by.	
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;	
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,	
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,	
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,	
I am a most poor woman and a stranger,	
I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and	
I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now	
I am a soldier and now bound to France.	
I am a soldier and unapt to weep	
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.	
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;	
I am as true as truth's simplicity,	
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.	
I am cut to th' brains.	
I am far better born than is the King,	
I am forsworn on mere necessity.	
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,	
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could	
I am in your debt for your last exercise;	
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.	
I am loath to beat thee.	
I am not in the roll of common men.	
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel	
I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,	
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought	
I am so angry at these abject terms;	
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.	
I am sorry you must hear. Upon my honour,	
I am thankful to you, and I'll go along	
I am that merry wanderer of the night.	
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,	
I am to-day i' th' vein of chivalry.	
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,	
I am troubled withal.	
I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.	
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm	
I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!	
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood	
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,	
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;	
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.	
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause	
I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,	
I cannot live out of her company.	
I cannot speak enough of this content;	
I cannot tremble at it. Were it toad, or adder, spider,	
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption	
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,	
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.	
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.	
I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve.	
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.	
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word	
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.	
I could beat forty of them.	
I could not answer in that course of honour	
I could set my ten commandments in your face.	
I crave your blessing.	
I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish	
I cry your mercy, madam; was it you?	
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.	
I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee	
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.	
I did present him with the Paris balls.	
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;	
I do but beg a little changeling boy	
I do defy him, and I spit at him,	
I do entreat you, not a man depart,	
I do mistake my person all this while.	
I do not like these several councils, I.	
I do perceive here a divided duty.	
I do perceive it hath offended you.	
I do refuse you for my judge and here,	
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York;	
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!	
I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.	
I draw a sword against conspirators;	
I fear there will a worse come in his place.	
I fear, too many curses on their heads	
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.	
I find an apt remission in myself;	
I flam'd amazement. Sometime I'd divide,	
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.	
I found her trimming up the diadem	
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.	
I from my mistress come to you in post;	
I gave bold way to my authority	
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.	
I give thee warrant of thy place, assure thee,	
I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument	
I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids	
I have a thousand spirits in one breast	
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,	
I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech	
I have lived long enough. My way of life	
I have not kept my square; but that to come	
I have not sought the day of this dislike.	
I have seen better faces in my time	
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,	
I have this present evening from my sister	
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,	
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,	
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it,	
I heard your guilty rhymes, observ'd your fashion,	
I here do give thee that with all my heart	
I here renounce him and return to Henry.	
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;	
I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.	
I hope you will consider what is spoke	
I kneel before thee, and unproperly	
I know I am too mean to be your queen,	
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,	
I know not how I shall assure you further	
I know not how a traitor.	
I know not if the day be ours or no;	
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,	
I know you wise; but yet no farther wise	
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.	
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,	
I leave your Highness. Grandam, I will pray,	
I led them on in this distracted fear,	
I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed;	
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;	
I may not prove inferior to yourself.	
I mean that married her, alack, good man!	
I mean, in bearing weight of government,	
I meant to rectify my conscience, which	
I met this crown; and I myself know well	
I must advance the colours of my love,	
I must away this night toward Padua,	
I must die much your debtor.	
I must each day say o'er the very same,	
I never gave them condign punishment.	
I never lov'd my brother in my life.	
I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye	
I never saw an action of such shame;	
I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;	
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures	
I pray thee, mark me that a brother should	
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.              Exit Roderigo.	
I prithee do not strive against my vows.	
I prithee turn aside and weep for her;	
I prithee, gentle friend,	
I prize above my dukedom.	
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.              Exit	
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd	
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,	
I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,	
I saw our party to their trenches driven,	
I saw upon her finger.	
I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed	
I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you	
I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.	
I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.	
I see report is fabulous and false.	
I serv'd my King, he would not in mine age	
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,	
I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.	
I shall return before your lordship thence.	
I should have been more strange, I must confess,	
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'	
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.	
I should not for my life but weep with him,	
I should rejoice now at this happy news;	
I speak no more than every one doth know.	
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	
I swear again I would not be a queen	
I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,	
I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer	
I tender my commission; by whose virtue-	
I therein do forget.	
I think I have his letter in my pocket.	
I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.	
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.	
I think you are all mated or stark mad.	
I think, to liberty. Yet am I better	
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;	
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,	
I thought you would not back again.	
I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,	
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,	
I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,	
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.	
I took him for the plainest harmless creature	
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King;	
I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I have him already	
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,	
I was my chamber's prisoner.	
I will assume thy part in some disguise	
I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once	
I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a a	
I will discharge thee.	
I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the	
I will forward with my device. [To the PRINCESS] Sweet royalty,	
I will from henceforth rather be myself,	
I will go there and do't, i' th' court, before	
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which	
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.	
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more	
I will reward you for this venturous deed.	
I will take order for her keeping close.	
I will with all expedient duty see you.	
I will yet do you service.	
I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to	
I would give it every foot to have this face!	
I would have left it on the board, so soon	
I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester	
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,	
I would not for the world.	
I would not from your love make such a stray	
I would not spend another such a night	
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.	
I would swim after.	
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.	
I would you rather had been silent. Please you	
I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy knee	
I wrote him Imogen was slain. 'Tis strange.	
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,	
I' th' East my pleasure lies.	
I' th' afternoon to sleep; there thou mayst brain him,	
I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit	
I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,	
I' th' plain way of his merit.	
I' th' privy chamber?	
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?	
I'll attend her here,	
I'll be your father and your brother too;	
I'll bear your logs the while; pray give me that;	
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he	
I'll buckler thee against a million.	
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair	
I'll choke myself- there's all I'll do for you.         Exit	
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.	
I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his	
I'll follow and enquire him out.	
I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him	
I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.	
I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.	
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep	
I'll join with black despair against my soul	
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.	
I'll make division of my present with you;	
I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.	
I'll mend it and then play-	
I'll none of him.	
I'll not be there.	
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,	
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.	
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,	
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;	
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.	
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,	
I'll tell ye more.	
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-	
I'll think them every one an Antony,	
I'll tickle your catastrophe.	
I'll to thy closet, and go read with thee	
I'll undertake to land them on our coast	
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.	
I'll win our ancient right in France again,	
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,	
I'm worse than mad; I have kept back their foes,	
IACHIMO. As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison-	
IACHIMO. More particulars	
IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot	
IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say	
IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense	
IACHIMO. Well, madam.	
IAGO.                                 Beshrew him for't!	
IAGO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.	
IAGO.                          Villainous whore!	
IAGO.                          You are- a senator.	
IAGO.                         I do beseech you-	
IAGO.                        Alas, alas!	
IAGO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!	
IAGO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.	
IAGO. After her, after her.	
IAGO. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,	
IAGO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,	
IAGO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?	
IAGO. I am about it, but indeed my invention	
IAGO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason	
IAGO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.	
IAGO. I did.	
IAGO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,	
IAGO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the	
IAGO. Marry, heaven forbid!	
IAGO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.	
IAGO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed	
IAGO. She that was ever fair and never proud,	
IAGO. Some wine, ho!	
IAGO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.	
IAGO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;	
IAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?	
IAGO. What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.	
IAGO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.	
IAGO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?	
IAGO. Will you hear't again?	
IAGO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the	
IAGO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;	
IAGO. You have not been abed, then?	
IAGO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.	
IAGO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.	
IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were	
IMOGEN. If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.	
IMOGEN. Most like-	
IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [Aside] If I do lie, and do	
IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I!	
IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!	
IRAS. The gods forbid!	
IRIS. A contract of true love to celebrate,	
ISABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.	
ISABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good	
ISABELLA. My business is a word or two with Claudio.	
ISABELLA. Nay, but it is not so.	
ISABELLA. O, peace! the friar is come.	
ISABELLA. Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?	
ISABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,	
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;	
If Cassius might have ruled.	
If Hamlet from himself be taken away,	
If I begin the batt'ry once again,	
If I do feign, you witnesses above	
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,	
If I know more of any man alive	
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	
If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'	
If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.	
If I would time expend with such a snipe	
If I would yield him my virginity	
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.	
If Talbot but survive thy treachery.	
If all could so become it.	
If any one relieves or pities him,	
If any spark of life be yet remaining,	
If any think brave death outweighs bad life	
If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-	
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise	
If by the way they be not fought withal.	
If ever I did dream of such a matter,	
If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,	
If ever sat at any good man's feast,	
If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn	
If for his tender here I make some stay.         [Lies down]	
If he should scorn me so apparently.	
If his occasion were not virtuous	
If in his death the gods have us befriended;	
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;	
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne	
If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;	
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.	
If not, the city being but of small defence,	
If opportunity and humblest suit	
If she had not a spirit to resist.	
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel.	
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	
If that the former dare but what it can,	
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent	
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,	
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,	
If they were his assistants, yea or no;	
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,	
If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.	
If this inducement move her not to love,	
If this right hand would buy two hours' life,	
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,	
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee	
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,	
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.	
If thou rememb'rest aught, ere thou cam'st here,	
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,	
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,	
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.	
If with a lady of so high resolve	
If wives do fall; say that they slack their duties	
If you be maid or no?	
If you be one, as you are well express'd	
If you be pleas'd, retire into my cell	
If you be well pleas'd with this,	
If you do find him, pray you give him this;	
If you go forward; therefore yield or die.	
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.	
If you should die before him, where's her dower?	
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;	
If you will marry, make your loves to me;	
If you will presently take horse with him	
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;	
If you would walk in absence of the sun.	
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;	
If your pure maidens fall into the hand	
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,	
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,	
Ill-weav'd ambition, how much art thou shrunk!	
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.	
Imagine I have said farewell already.	
Immediately they will again be here	
Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth	
Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]	
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceas'd	
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:	
In Italy, and her confederate arms,	
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,	
In a new channel fair and evenly.	
In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves	
In a rich chair of state, opposing freely	
In acclamations hyperbolical,	
In all designs begun on earth below	
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.	
In any staining act.	
In anything that I do know by her.	
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.	
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.	
In borrow'd robes?	
In braving arms against thy sovereign.	
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize	
In confutation of which rude reproach	
In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,	
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.	
In differences so mighty. If she be	
In dignity, and for the liberal arts	
In doing courtesies; and one in whom	
In embassy to his mother; his body's hostage	
In entertainment to my princely queen.	
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,	
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.	
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,	
In following him, I follow but myself;	
In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,	
In heaps and piles of ruin.	
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;	
In his bright radiance and collateral light	
In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia	
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them-	
In like conditions as our argument,	
In many's looks, the false heart's history	
In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.	
In me defunct- and proper satisfaction;	
In mine own country, lords.	
In mortal fury half so peremptory	
In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,	
In music, instruments, and poetry,	
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,	
In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers,	
In peace, to his utmost peril.	
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,	
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,	
In resolution to keep Helen still;	
In seven short years that here my only son	
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.	
In solemn show attend this funeral,	
In some large measure to thy father's death	
In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,	
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.	
In spite of us or aught that we could do.	
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!	
In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,	
In that's no changeling, and I must excuse	
In the corrupted currents of this world	
In the dark backward and abysm of time?	
In the old time of war, would shake the press,	
In the protection of his son, her brother,	
In the sight	
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;	
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.	
In their distractions. They now are in my pow'r;	
In their nativity all truth appears.	
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,	
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?	
In this man's place before him?	
In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed	
In this vile action; for the success,	
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;	
In thy despite shall scape mortality.	
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect	
In thy uprightness and integrity,	
In time we hate that which we often fear.	
In war was never lion rag'd more fierce,	
In what thou hadst to say; so, with good life	
In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.	
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,	
In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.	
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide	
Incapable of more, replete with you,	
Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce	
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose	
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,	
Inform on that.	
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,	
Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.	
Into his study of imagination,	
Into my story; say 'Thus mine enemy fell,	
Into our city with thy banners spread.	
Into the flame.	
Into the madness wherein now he raves,	
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.	
Into two parties, is now conjoin'd in one,

Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;

Is coming towards me, and my inward soul	
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense

Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,	
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian-	
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,	
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose	
Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.

Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,	
Is nam'd your wars in France. This makes bold mouths;	
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,	
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?	
Is nothing left me but my body's length.	
Is poorly imitated after you,	
Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,	
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;	
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;	
Is she not, then, beholding to the man	
Is so possess'd with guilt. Come from thy ward;	
Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle.	
Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters	
Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?	
Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire	
Is the great love the general gender bear him,	
Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first	
Is this the face which fac'd so many follies	
Is this the fashions in the court of England?	
Is thy name Tyrrel?

Is valiant and dejected; and by starts	
Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.	
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women	
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms

It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.	
It beggar'd all description. She did lie	
It burneth in the Capels' monument.	
It hath been taught us from the primal state	
It hath no end.	
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,	
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,	
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper-	
It is most retrograde to our desire;	
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate	
It is not possible, it cannot be	
It is not so with Him that all things knows,	
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,	
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.	
It must not be. If Cassio do remain,	
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.	
It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it	
It shall not wind with such a deep indent	
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.	
It thunders and lightens terribly; then the SPIRIT riseth]	
It useth an enforced ceremony.	
It was a vision fair and fortunate.	
It was my instant death. By accident	
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.	
It were a better death than die with mocks,	
It were but necessary you were wak'd,

Laer. Well, again!	
Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,	
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,	
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;	
Last in the field and almost lords of it!	
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.	
Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipp'd	
Launcelot?	
Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?	
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,

Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.	
Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?	
Lear. Is this well spoken?	
Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.	
Lear. O vassal! miscreant!	
Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!	
Lear. Read.	
Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!	
Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride

Leon. My heart is with your liking.	
Leon. O, by no means! She mocks all her wooers out of suit.	
Leon. Sweet Prince, why speak not you?	
Leon. That eye my daughter lent her. 'Tis most true.

Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,	
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.	
Let us sway on and face them in the field.	
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;	
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,	
Let's call more help to have them bound again.	
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.	
Let's have your company; or, if you please,	
Let's think in private more.                               Exeunt

Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.	
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,	
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?	
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;	
Like elves and fairies in a ring,	
Like him that travels I return again,	
Like monsters of the deep.	
Like one of two contending in a prize,	
Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,	
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;	
Like the old age.	
Like to a censer in a barber's shop.	
Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,	
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then

Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,	
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read	
Look him i' th' face.	
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,	
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.	
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;	
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,	
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.	
Look there, look there!                            He dies.	
Look through a casement to allure false hearts,	
Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words	
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.	
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!	
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;	
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!	
Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,	
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!	
Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.	
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?	
Look, he has spied us.	
Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.	
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!	
Looking before and after, gave us not

Made in her concave shores?	
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,	
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.	
Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd	
Made me to blame in memory.	
Made old offences of affections new.	
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,	
Made such a sinner of his memory,	
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,	
Made to run even upon even ground,	
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.

Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,	
Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]

Make this his latest farewell to their souls.	
Make thy demand aloud. [To IACHIMO] Sir, step you forth;	
Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves	
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?	
Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.	
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,	
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.

May equally determine.	
May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.	
May hold him from the Capitol today.

May justly diet me. I pray you yet-	
May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.	
May never glorious sun reflex his beams	
May reasonably die, and never rise	
May safely come to him and be resolved

Methinks King Richard and myself should meet	
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.	
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;	
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	
Might but redeem the passage of your age!	
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace	
Might stop our countryman.	
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,	
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?	
Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,	
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;	
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?	
Misthink the King, and not be satisfied!	
Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?	
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,	
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,	
Money and order for their furniture.	
More after our commandment than as guided	
More composition and fierce quality	
More daring or more bold, is now alive	
More dazzled and drove back his enemies	
More fearful, is deliver'd.	
More fierce and more inexorable far	
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends	
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.	
More hath it merited- that let it have.	
More near my life, I fear, with my weak wit,	
More out of malice than integrity,	
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well	
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;	
More sharp to me than spurring to his side,	
More should I question thee, and more I must,	
More than Octavius and Mark Antony	
More than cool reason ever comprehends.	
More than in women commonly is seen,	
More than mine own; that am, have, and will be-	
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate	
More than my father's skill, which was the great'st	
More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me,	
More truly now may this be verified;	
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.	
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,	
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.	
Most lamentable day, most woful day	
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;	
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.	
Most rich in Timon's nod.	
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.	
Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope	
Most welcome!	
Most worthy brother England; fairly met!	
Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;	
Mother, I am going to the market-place;	
Moulded the stuff so fair	
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed	
Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils,	
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason	
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!	
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.	
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.	
Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;	
Music.	
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.	
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?	
Must I then do't to them?	
Must as a foreign recreant be led	
Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit	
Must be thy subject; who, in spite, put stuff	
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.	
Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story	
Must either punish me, not being believ'd,	
Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!	
Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,	
Must needs appear offence.	
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.	
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.	
Must not continue friends.	
Must shuffle for itself.	
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.          Exeunt	
Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.	
My Alcibiades.- With me? What is your will?	
My Desdemona must I leave to thee.	
My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er;	
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,	
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,	
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?	
My Lord of York, it better show'd with you	
My absence doth neglect no great design	
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin	
My brother he is in Elysium.	
My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,	
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,	
My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.	
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.	
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.	
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.	
My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know	
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,	
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,	
My fancy to your eyes. When I consider	
My father and Glendower being both away,	
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,	
My hand is ready, may it do him ease.	
My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it	
My head as I do his.	
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd.	
My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;	
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,	
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.	
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	
My husband lost his life to get the crown;	
My joy of liberty is half eclips'd.	
My lady sweet, arise;	
My letter will resolve him of my mind.	
My liege! my lord! But now a king-now thus.	
My lodging out.  [To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery	
My lord, not I.	
My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,	
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	
My love with words and errors still she feeds,	
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;	
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!	
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.	
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,	
My mother, being heir unto the crown,	
My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.	
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;	
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,	
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,	
My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,	
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive	
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,	
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,	
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.	
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander-	
My services, which I have done the signiory,	
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,	
My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.	
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;	
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,	
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	
My state was nothing, I should then have told you	
My strong imagination sees a crown	
My studied purposes requite; which went	
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.	
My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize	
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-	
My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds	
My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,	
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,	
My trusty servant well approv'd in all,	
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-	
My woeful self up in a mournful house,	
Myself against the level of mine aim;	
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;	
Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility	
Myself would on the rearward of reproaches

NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much	
NORTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!	
NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,

NORTHUMBERLAND. Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,

Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;	
Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,	
Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.

Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,	
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.

No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately	
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay

No elder than a boy!	
No further harm.	
No lady closer, for I well believe	
No less importing than our general good,	
No matter then although my foot did stand	
No more than he'll unswear.	
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence	
No new device to beat this from his brains?	
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall	
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon	
No way to that, for weakness, which she ent'red.	
No, I will weep no more. In such a night	
No, but not yet! May be he is not well.	
No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.	
No, no, my heart will burst, an if I speak-	
No.	
No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;	
No; to the spital go,	
No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.	
Noble she is; but if she have forgot

None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,	
None but for some, and yet all different.	
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind.	
Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,	
Nor age so eat up my invention,	
Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,	
Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,	
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-	
Nor cease his flow of riot; takes no account	
Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.	
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;	
Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,	
Nor faint in the pursuit.	
Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.	
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?	
Nor never by advised purpose meet	
Nor never needed that I should entreat,	
Nor once deject the courage of our minds	
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;	
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.	
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd	
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,	
Nor shall not now; for in companions	
Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.	
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.	
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,	
Nor the division of a battle knows	
Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,	
Nor well, unless in mind; his letter there	
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,	
Nor will you tender less.	
Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes	
Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.	
North. Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.	
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,	
Not able to endure the sight of day,	
Not after our command. Away with her,	
Not as a brother.	
Not as a groom. There's some of ye, I see,	
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,	
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed	
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;	
Not his that spoils her young before her face.	
Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,	
Not knowing why.	
Not lack your company.	
Not making any scruple of her soilure,	
Not only with what my revenue yielded,	
Not poison any further.	
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go	
Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,	
Not unaccompanied invest him only,	
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.	
Now I am alone.	
Now I perceive that she hath made compare	
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.	
Now counting best to be with you alone,	
Now falls on Priam.	
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,	
Now get thee hence: the King, thou know'st, is coming;	
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland	
Now is the time that face should form another,	
Now lays upon you.	
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;	
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,	
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.	
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	
Now to deliver her possession up	
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a pow'r	
Now will he sit under a medlar tree	
Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own,	
Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,	
Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,	
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me	
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;	
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords	
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.	
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum	
Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an 'a	
Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.	
Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo	
Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,	
Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?	
Nurse. Madam!	
Nurse. May not one speak?	
Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.	
Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.	
Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!	
O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!	
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?	
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;	
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd	
O blessed bond of board and bed!	
O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather	
O happy torment, when my torturer	
O heavy burthen!	
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!	
O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!	
O know sweet love I always write of you,	
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause	
O look, sir; look, sir! Here is more of us!	
O never say that I was false of heart,	
O no, thy love though much, is not so great,	
O peers of England, shameful is this league!	
O reverend Tribunes! O gentle aged men!	
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!	
O that I were a glove upon that hand,	
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-	
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!	
O though I love what others do abhor,	
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!	
O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.	
O'er-priz'd all popular rate, in my false brother	
O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;	
O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,	
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,	
O, burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.             Exit	
O, coward that I am, to live so long,	
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!	
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye	
O, ho!	
O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!	
O, if in black my lady's brows be deckt,	
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer	
O, let it not be said! Forage, and run	
O, may diseases only work upon't!	
O, my lord, y'are tardy,	
O, say!	
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!	
O, that once more you knew but what you are!	
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,	
O, torture me no more! I will confess.	
O, vengeance!	
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,	
O, what a scandal is it to our crown	
O, what a scene of fool'ry have I seen,	
O, what a world is this, when what is comely	
O, when the King did throw his warder down-	
O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?	
O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?	
O- Desdemona-	
OBERON.       Flower of this purple dye,	
OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.	
OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-	
OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.	
OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.	
OFFICER. Masters, let him go;	
OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well,	
OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me	
OLIVIA'S garden	
OLIVIA. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,	
OLIVIA. Ay, my lord, this same.	
OLIVIA. By mine honour, half drunk! What is he at the gate, cousin?	
OLIVIA. Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,	
OLIVIA. Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.	
OLIVIA. How now! Art thou mad?	
OLIVIA. I would you were as I would have you be!	
OLIVIA. O, by your leave, I pray you:	
OLIVIA. O, do not swear!	
OLIVIA. O, say so, and so be!                           Exeunt	
OLIVIA. Prithee read i' thy right wits.	
OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord.	
OLIVIA. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the	
OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	
OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	
ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.	
ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.	
ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are	
ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?	
ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.	
ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!	
ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de	
ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father	
ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.	
ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.	
ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.	
ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	
ORLANDO. What's that?	
ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?	
ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.	
ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in	
ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in	
ORLEANS. What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of	
ORSINO, Duke of Illyria	
OTHELLO.                            I think thou dost;	
OTHELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.	
OTHELLO.                       No, his mouth is stopp'd;	
OTHELLO.                       O fool! fool! fool!	
OTHELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.	
OTHELLO.                      What is the matter here?	
OTHELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.	
OTHELLO.             'Tis well I am found by you.	
OTHELLO.             I do believe 'twas he.	
OTHELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?	
OTHELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!	
OTHELLO. Amen, with all my heart!	
OTHELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for	
OTHELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.	
OTHELLO. I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.	
OTHELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?	
OTHELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?	
OTHELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see	
OTHELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a	
OTHELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!	
OTHELLO. O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.	
OTHELLO. Say you?	
OTHELLO. What dost thou say?	
OTHELLO. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?	
OTHELLO. What would you with her, sir?	
OTHELLO. What, not a whore?	
OTHELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.	
Obey our will, which travails in thy good;	
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,	
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land	
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!	
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.	
Of France and England, did this king succeed;	
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!	
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!	
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-	
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together	
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking	
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,	
Of burning youth.	
Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;	
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt	
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;	
Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum	
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,	
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns	
Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;	
Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,	
Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!	
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.	
Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:	
Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness	
Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.	
Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns	
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;	
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,	
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich	
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.	
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain	
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow	
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.        Exeunt	
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,	
Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,	
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,	
Of man and beast the infinite malady	
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,	
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.	
Of my consent that she should be your wife.	
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?	
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,	
Of my good purposes, and put your children	
Of my wive's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,	
Of nature be corrupted through affection;	
Of no more bondage be to where they are made	
Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,	
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state	
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,	
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,	
Of our two cousins' coming into London.	
Of pale and bloodless emulation.	
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,	
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,	
Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.	
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely;	
Of present death.	
Of present dues. The future comes apace;	
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt	
Of secret on her person, that he could not	
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,	
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,	
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.	
Of such a time: being my sworn servant,	
Of such an ungrown warrior.	
Of such misery doth she cut me off.	
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe	
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain;	
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.	
Of that report which I so oft have heard.	
Of that same noble prelate well-belov'd,	
Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not	
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates	
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.	
Of the great Count himself, she is too mean	
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.	
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,	
Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight-	
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,	
Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.	
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st	
Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late	
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.	
Of what I feel. I am all patience.	
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;	
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded-envy;	
Of what conditions we shall stand upon?	
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality	
Of woeful ages long ago betid;	
Of your infirmity?	
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive	
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note	
Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,	
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,	
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,	
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,	
Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad!	
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice	
Olympus-high, and duck again as low	
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,	
On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,	
On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting	
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end	
On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum	
On either side I come to spend my breath,	
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.	
On his behalf.	
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?	
On the bat's back I do fly	
On the enchafed flood.	
On them to look, and practise by myself.	
On whom depending, their obedience fails	
On whose eyes I might approve	
On yon proud man should take it off again	
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,	
Once more, what news?	
Once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;	
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,	
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!	
One half of me is yours, the other half yours-	
One might interpret.	
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.	
One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;	
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,	
One that you love.	
One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy'd with fat	
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be	
Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls	
Only she comes too short, that I profess	
Open, locks,	
Oph. (sings)	
Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love	
Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.	
Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!	
Oph. What means your lordship?	
Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.	
Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.	
Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.	
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits	
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard	
Or I'll be buried in the king's high way,	
Or as a moat defensive to a house,	
Or as it were the pageants of the sea-	
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.	
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.	
Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?	
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite	
Or else I will discover nought to thee.	
Or else I'll call my brother back again,	
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.	
Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,	
Or else thou diest to-morrow.	
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.	
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.	
Or else you love not; for to be wise and love	
Or else you may return without your money.	
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!	
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,	
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more	
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:	
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,	
Or if not so, thy noble heart to break.	
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life	
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,	
Or know not what we are.	
Or less than a just pound- be it but so much	
Or lose my labour in assaying it.	
Or lose myself in dotage.	
Or lose our ventures.	
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open	
Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends	
Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,	
Or sack this country with a mutiny.                   Exeunt	
Or shall I come to you at evening mass	
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?	
Or shall we on without apology?	
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.	
Or take his life there. This if she perform,	
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,	
Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,	
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,	
Or thrive by other means.	
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,	
Or useful serving-man and instrument	
Or we are Romans and will give you that,	
Or what is he of basest function	
Or what you will command me will I do,	
Or who should study to prefer a peace,	
Or wrath or craft may get him.	
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?	
Or, if I live, is it not very like	
Or, if he do, let it at least be said	
Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,	
Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.	
Orlando. What do you say, sister?	
Orpheus with his lute made trees,	
Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?	
Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	
Osw. Ay, madam.	
Osw. So please you-                                      Exit.	
Osw. Where may we set our horses?	
Our Roman hunting.	
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'	
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.	
Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!	
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which	
Our archers shall be placed in the midst.	
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought;	
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo.?	
Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.	
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,	
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.	
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.	
Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure	
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,	
Our fine musician groweth amorous.	
Our free hearts each to other.	
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.	
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd	
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;	
Our love being yours, the error that love makes	
Our messenger Chatillon is arriv'd.	
Our neighbour shepherd's son!	
Our own precedent passions do instruct us	
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.                     Exeunt	
Our peace will, like a broken limb united,	
Our reverend Cardinal carried.	
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,	
Our talk must only be of Benedick.	
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage	
Our worser genius can, shall never melt	
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;	
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.	
Ourselves to be.	
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.-	
Out of the King's protection. This is my charge.	
Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it	
Out of the mind.	
Out of the way, that your converse and business	
Out of those many regist'red in promise,	
Out of your best advice.	
Out-swell the colic of puff Aquilon'd.	
Owes nothing to thy blasts.

PAINTER	
PAINTER. A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?	
PAINTER. He and myself	
PAINTER. Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again,

PANDARUS. A goodly medicine for my aching bones! world! world! thus	
PANDARUS. An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,	
PANDARUS. Ay, a token from Troilus.	
PANDARUS. But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that	
PANDARUS. Condition I had gone barefoot to India.	
PANDARUS. Helenus! no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I marvel	
PANDARUS. Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!	
PANDARUS. How now, how now! How go maidenheads?	
PANDARUS. I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his	
PANDARUS. I speak no more than truth.	
PANDARUS. I will, sweet queen.                Exit. Sound a retreat	
PANDARUS. That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty	
PANDARUS. What, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?	
PANDARUS. Who's there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth,

PANDARUS. Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!	
PANDARUS. You spy! What do you spy?-Come, give me an instrument.	
PANDULPH.  [Gives back the crown]  Take again	
PANDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!	
PANDULPH. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.	
PARIS. A valiant Greek, Aeneas -take his hand:	
PARIS. Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.	
PARIS. Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,	
PARIS. Hark! Hector's trumpet.	
PARIS. Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry	
PARIS. Sweet, above thought I love thee.                     Exeunt	
PARIS. This is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting	
PARIS. To a hair.	
PARIS. Well said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.	
PARIS. [Within] Brother Troilus!	
PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.	
PAROLLES. Ay, sir.	
PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?	
PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits	
PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen	
PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.	
PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.	
PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,	
PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.	
PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.	
PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in	
PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.	
PAROLLES. That's for advantage.	
PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule	
PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.	
PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-	
PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.	
PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.	
PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.	
PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too

PEMBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee	
PERCY. Yes, my good lord,	
PETER, friar	
PETER. Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.	
PETO. The King your father is at Westminster;	
PETRUCHIO'S country house	
PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.-	
PETRUCHIO. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.	
PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?	
PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do	
PETRUCHIO. Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.

ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.	
ROSALIND. Ay, but when?	
ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?	
ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,	
ROSALIND. Do you think so?	
ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?	
ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious	
ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.	
ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold	
ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a	
ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know	
ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily	
ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth	
ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion	
ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I	
ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:	
ROSALIND. Not true in love?	
ROSALIND. O excellent young man!	
ROSALIND. That he hath not.	
ROSALIND. Were it not better,	
ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?	
ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to	
ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by	
ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, and two other LORDS	
ROSALINE. I would you knew.	
ROSALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.	
ROSALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.	
ROSALINE. Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but	
ROSALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case	
ROSALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.	
ROSALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.

Seek through your camp to find you.	
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.	
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,	
Seem to me all the uses of this world!	
Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,	
Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword	
Send fair-play orders, and make compromise,	
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;	
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.	
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.	
Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written

Set down by th' poll?	
Set down our host. My partner in this action,	
Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,	
Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;	
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;	
Set on.                        Exeunt the KING and his train	
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,	
Seven times tried that judgment is

Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,	
Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;	
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.	
Shall I have justice? What says Jupiter?	
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,	
Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come.	
Shall be the maws of kites.                      Exit Ghost.	
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;	
Shall carry from me to the Empress' sons	
Shall disturb this hallowed house.	
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.	
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	
Shall harm Macbeth.                                Descends.	
Shall have the chinks.	
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar	
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd	
Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly.	
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,	
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death	
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath	
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,	
Shall more attend upon the coming space,	
Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,	
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.	
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;	
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,	
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes	
Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."	
Shall soon enjoy.	
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.	
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him;	
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.

Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that peradventures	
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;	
Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess	
She and the Duke her husband!	
She either gives a stomach and no food-	
She has robb'd me of my sword.	
She hath not given so many good words breath	
She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite	
She is a woman, therefore may be won;	
She is our capital demand, compris'd	
She is thy enemy and I thy friend.	
She may help you to many fair preferments	
She puts her tongue a little in her heart	
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd.           Exit	
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,	
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day	
She was often cited by them, but appear'd not.	
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,	
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.	
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice	
She's gone. I am abused, and my relief	
She's very near her hour.	
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.	
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius	
Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept	
Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,	
Should chance-	
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,	
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?	
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!	
Should many people, under two commands,	
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,	
Should say myself offended, and with you	
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood	
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.	
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs	
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree	
Should yawn at alteration.	
Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,	
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.	
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,	
Shrewsbury.	
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,	
Sickness is catching; O, were favour so,	
Signior Baptista may remember me	
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?	
Since God so graciously hath brought to light	
Since I have my dukedom got,	
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?	
Since all and every part of what we would	
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.	
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;	
Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,	
Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me.	
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,	
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,	
Since you are like to see the King before me,	
Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.	
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,	
Sing all a green willow;	
Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,	
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,	
Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student	
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,	
Sir Richard Vernon.	
Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.	
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;	
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.	
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;	
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-	
Sirrah, what's thy name?	
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven	
Sith priest and holy water are so near,	
Sith that the justice of your title to him	
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,	
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,	
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.	
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.	
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy;	
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,	
Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a	
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice	
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony	
So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.                  Exeunt	
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;	
So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite	
So are you, princes English, every one.	
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive	
So can I name his faults.	
So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,	
So excellent a king, that was to this	
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,	
So far from variation or quick change?	
So feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join	
So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung	
So full of dismal terror was the time!	
So get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;	
So good night, with lullaby.	
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,	
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread	
So great indignities you laid upon me?	
So happy is your brother.	
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear	
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night-	
So help me every spirit sanctified,	
So high above his limits swells the rage	
So his familiars to his buried fortunes	
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul	
So is Alcides beaten by his page;	
So keen and greedy to confound a man.	
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,	
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!	
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,	
So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd	
So much as lank'd not.	
So much as this fact comes to? [Reads] 'Do't. The letter	
So much by weight hate I her Diomed.	
So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you	
So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw	
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,	
So oft it chances in particular men	
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus	
So shall I no whit be behind in duty	
So shall she leave her blessedness to one-	
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,	
So should that beauty which you hold in lease	
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow	
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,	
So sways she level in her husband's heart.	
So sweet is zealous contemplation.	
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart	
So tell your master.	
So that my lord your son were not my brother-	
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.	
So that the art and practic part of life	
So they	
So to the Moor.	
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness	
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,	
So will you say when you have seen the Sequel.	
So you do condescend to help me now.	
So, Ilion, fall thou next! Come, Troy, sink down;	
So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue	
So, farewell, Reignier. Set this diamond safe	
So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,	
So.	
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,	
Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,	
Sole imperator, and great general	
Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS	
Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,	
Some busy and insinuating rogue,	
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,	
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?	
Some fair excuse.	
Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.	
Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,	
Some misadventure.	
Some offer me commodities to buy;	
Some parcels of their power are forth already,	
Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets	
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil!	
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.	
Some, of violated vows	
Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly	
Something I must do to procure me grace.	
Something against our meanings, have prevented-	
Something not worth in me such rich beholding	
Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost	
Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure,	
Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times	
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.	
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,	
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit	
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you	
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,	
Sound a parley. Enter REIGNIER on the walls	
Sound drum and trumpets and to London all;	
Sound trumpets. Enter the KING, the QUEEN,	
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,	
Sow all th' Athenian bosoms, and their crop	
Spare speech.	
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!	
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,	
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns	
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.	
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,	
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!	
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.	
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,	
Speak.	
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,	
Sperr up the sons of Troy.	
Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?	
Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told,	
Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!	
Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near	
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.	
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit	
Stand ranks of people, and they cry, "A sail!"	
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke	
Stands on the hourly thought.	
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,	
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when	
Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.	
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,	
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing	
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.	
Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;	
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.	
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,	
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,	
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself	
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew	
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,	
Straight how 'tis like to go.                           Exit	
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;	
Stretch him out longer.	
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,	
Strike those that make them; and their story is	
Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.	
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.          Exeunt	
Subdue him at his peril.	
Successively from age to age, he built it?	
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect	
Such a foe, good heavens!                 Exit into the cave	
Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.	
Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young;	
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes	
Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,	
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.	
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,	
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:	
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,	
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,	
Suddenly made him from my side to start	
Sufficing strokes for death.	
Suffolk first died; and York, all haggled over,	
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.	
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.	
Suspecting that we both were in a house	
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,	
Swear by my sword.	
Swear by my sword.	
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself	
Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,	
Sweats in the eye of Pheebus, and all night	
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I call'd thee?	
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said	
Sweet, say on.	
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,	
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps	
T' oppose your cunning. Y'are meek and humble-mouth'd;	
TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?	
TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?	
TALBOT. A maid, they say.	
TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy.	
TALBOT. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond	
TALBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;	
TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!	
TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner	
TALBOT. Thou antic Death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,	
TALBOT. Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,	
TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and AARON	
TAMORA. And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,	
TAMORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!	
TAMORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,	
TAMORA. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,	
TAMORA. So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee;	
TAMORA. Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,

THESEUS. Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.	
THESEUS. I must confess that I have heard so much,	
THESEUS. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,	
THESEUS. Well run, Thisby.

THOMAS WART	
THREE GENTLEMEN	
TIMON. All to you. Lights, more lights!	
TIMON. And so am I to you.	
TIMON. Away,	
TIMON. Does she love him?	
TIMON. Freely, good father.	
TIMON. I have a tree, which grows here in my close,	
TIMON. I have so; what of him?	
TIMON. I thank them; and would send them back the plague,	
TIMON. I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns	
TIMON. Keep it: I cannot eat it.	
TIMON. Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take	
TIMON. My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.	
TIMON. O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth	
TIMON. Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.	
TIMON. Prithee no more.	
TIMON. Right welcome, sir!	
TIMON. That's a lascivious apprehension.	
TIMON. The man is honest.	
TIMON. This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long;.	
TIMON. Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity.	
TIMON. Thou sun that comforts, burn. Speak and be hang'd!	
TIMON. What wouldst do then, Apemantus?	
TIMON. Wherefore?	
TITANIA. My Oberon! What visions have I seen!	
TITINIUS,     "     "    "	
TITINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,	
TITUS, when wert thou wont to walk alone,	
TITUS.  [To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor;	
TITUS. 'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?	
TITUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.	
TITUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;	
TITUS. Ha! ha!	
TITUS. Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!	
TITUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?	
TITUS. If there were reason for these miseries,	
TITUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,	
TITUS. Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,	
TITUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.	
TITUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.	
TITUS. No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-	
TITUS. Will it consume me? Let me see it then.	
TITUS. Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness feed?	
TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.	
TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?	
TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet	
TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and	
TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such	
TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.	
TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor	
TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and	
TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.	
TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good	
TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-	
TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were	
TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a

TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?	
TRANIO. Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.	
TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,	
TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.	
TRANIO. See not your bride in these unreverent robes;	
TRANIO. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?	
TRAVERS and MORTON, retainers of Northumberland	
TRAVERS. My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back	
TRESSEL and BERKELEY, gentlemen attending on Lady Anne	
TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel	
TRINCULO. Where should they be set else? He were a brave	
TROILUS. Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are	
TROILUS. Away, away!	
TROILUS. Dear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.	
TROILUS. Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!	
TROILUS. I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.	
TROILUS. O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!	
TROILUS. O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor,	
TROILUS. Pandarus!	
TROILUS. Sweet Pandarus!	
TROILUS. They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,	
TROILUS. Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.	
TROILUS. What offends you, lady?	
TROILUS. What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?	
TROILUS. Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault!	
TWO BRITISH CAPTAINS	
Take all myself.	
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves	
Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.	
Take in your love, and then let me alone.	
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,	
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.	
Take pity of your town and of your people	
Take special care my greetings be delivered.	
Take thy commission.	
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;	
Take, O, take those lips away,	
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.	
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,	
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-	
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,	
Teach you our princess English?	
Tell her my love, more noble than the world,	
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower-	
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler	
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,	
Tell me for truth the measure of his love	
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.	
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.	
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.	
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?	
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,	
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples	
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed;	
Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.	
Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:	
Th' elected deer before thee?	
Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage	
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,	
Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,	
Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:	
Th' untented woundings of a father's curse	
Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up	
Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, should again unite	
Than Bargulus, the strong Illyrian pirate.	
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.	
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,	
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;	
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:	
Than by the negligent.	
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world	
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him	
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.	
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,	
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy	
Than drink so much in one.	
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.	
Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,	
Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,	
Than fly to others that we know not of?	
Than gain which darkens him.	
Than have seen this.	
Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.	
Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him	
Than is a slave in base servility;	
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;	
Than music from the spheres.	
Than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy.	
Than other princess' can, that have more time	
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner	
Than so much loss of time.	
Than stands on any shoulder that I see	
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;	
Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,	
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.	
Than to take in a town with gentle words,	
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.	
Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;	
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts	
That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.	
That England, being empty of defence,	
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,	
That God, the law, my honour, and her love	
That I am Viola; which to confirm,	
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes	
That I did kill them.	
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!	
That I did so when I was first assur'd.	
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard	
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding	
That I have sent her, by her own command	
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,	
That I might love thee something.	
That I might see what the old world could say,	
That I must call't in question.	
That I must love a loathed enemy.	
That I myself have done unto myself?	
That I repair to Rome, I am content.	
That I shall blush in acting, and might well	
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop	
That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling	
That I was not ignoble of descent:	
That I will by to-morrow dinner time	
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,	
That I yet know not?	
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think	
That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,	
That Margaret may be England's royal Queen.	
That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	
That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,	
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;	
That all particulars of duty know	
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,	
That angel of the world- doth make distinction	
That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,	
That any harm should stain so fair a show!	
That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake	
That art thyself a man?	
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,	
That bids me be of comfort any more.	
That both the world, I give to negligence,	
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.	
That brought you home and boldly did outdare	
That bucket down and fun of tears am I,	
That came awooing with you, and so many a time	
That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.	
That censures falsely what they see aright?	
That chair stand empty; but we all are men,	
That chase thee from thy country, and expose	
That dare as well answer a man indeed	
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,	
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,	
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her	
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!	
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,	
That e'er invention play'd on? Tell me why.	
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,	
That ever I should live to see thee dead!	
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.	
That ever liv'd.	
That ever said I heark'ned for your death.	
That ever was survey'd by English eye-	
That every eye which in this forest looks	
That every one her own hath garnished	
That everything I look on seemeth green;	
That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.	
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone	
That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n	
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd	
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,	
That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd	
That had a head to hit, either young or old,	
That had not half a week to go, like rams	
That has done worthy service.	
That has no relish of salvation in't-	
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare	
That hath to this maturity blown up	
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis	
That have been so bedazzled with the sun	
That have no use for trusting. If your master	
That have their alms out of the Empress' chest.	
That having such a scope to show her pride,	
That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,	
That he enchants societies into him,	
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land	
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours	
That he which hath your noble father slain	
That he would labour my delivery.	
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:	
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together	
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,	
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.	
That hour destroy us?	
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!	
That if about this hour he make this way,	
That if it chance the one of us do fail	
That is removed by a staff of France;	
That is your part. Yet I am advis'd to do it;	
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter	
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.	
That it may stand till the perpetual doom	
That justice seizes. What knows the laws	
That know love's grief by his complexion!	
That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,	
That lately stole his daughter-	
That like a jewel has hung twenty years	
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.	
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,	
That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,	
That love my friend, and that they know full well	
That magical word of war, we have effected;	
That makes such waste in brief mortality.	
That makes the Senate ugly.	
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.	
That many have and others must sit there;	
That may with foul intrusion enter in	
That means to be of note, begins betimes.	
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,	
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.	
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands	
That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;	
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.	
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain	
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.	
That nightly lie in those unproper beds	
That no compunctious visitings of nature	
That no man is the lord of anything,	
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,	
That numberless upon me stuck, as leaves	
That of all things upon the earth he hated	
That of thy death and business I can tell.	
That one by one pursue; if you give way,	
That our great king himself doth woo me oft	
That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know	
That policy may either last so long,	
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence	
That respites me a life whose very comfort	
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.	
That sets him high in fame.	
That shake not though they blow perpetually.	
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,	
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death	
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart	
That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows	
That she preparedly may frame herself	
That she which marries you must marry me,	
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;	
That should deracinate such savagery;	
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,	
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,	
That slily glided towards your Majesty,	
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick	
That so my sad decrees may fly away	
That some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd	
That some plain man recount their purposes.	
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave	
That such an army could be drawn in France,	
That sucks the nurse asleep?	
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him	
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day	
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.	
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand	
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,	
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,	
That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,	
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,	
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.	
That they have let the dangerous enemy	
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile	
That things ill got had ever bad success?	
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,	
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth	
That this our court, infected with their manners,	
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st	
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.	
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,	
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.	
That thou neglect me not with that opinion	
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.	
That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?	
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,	
That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.	
That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose	
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,	
That time and place with this deceit so lawful	
That time best fits the work we have in hand.	
That to her brother which I said to thee:	
That to the use of actions fair and good	
That took away the match from Isabel,	
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;	
That treason can but peep to what it would,	
That very manners urges.	
That want their leader, scatter up and down	
That we could hear no news of his repair?	
That we have had no time to move our daughter.	
That we may do it still without accompt.	
That we should dress us fairly for our end.	
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage.	
That were with him exil'd. This to be true	
That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;	
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd	
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,	
That which t' appear itself must not yet be	
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop	
That will speak anything?	
That with our small conjunction we should on,	
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:	
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep	
That worthied him, got praises of the King	
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,	
That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes.	
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,	
That you and I should meet upon such terms	
That you depart and lay no hands on me.	
That you have but slumb'red here	
That you have slander'd so?	
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,	
That you stand pensive as half malcontent?	
That you your self may privilage your time	
That your attempts may overlive the hazard	
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.	
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,	
That's paragon'd o' th' world.	
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,	
That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.	
That, for the health and physic of our right,	
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,	
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,	
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,	
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by	
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice	
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.	
That, when the exigent should come- which now	
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,	
The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss	
The Cardinal's malice and his potency	
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,	
The DUKE'S palace	
The DUKE'S palace	
The Devil himself.	
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish	
The Duke himself, and the magnificoes	
The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready;	
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.	
The Forum.	
The French and English, there miscarried	
The French camp near Agincourt	
The Garter Inn	
The Ghost of Caesar	
The KING retires attended	
The King had cut off my head with my brother's.	
The King hath cause to plain.	
The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,	
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;	
The King will always think him in our debt,	
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal	
The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.	
The King's camp near Shrewsbury.	
The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon	
The Lady Cressida.	
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,	
The QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair,	
The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women.	
The WIDOW'S house	
The air of paradise did fan the house,	
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.	
The argument you held was wrong in you;	
The arm of mine own body, and the heart	
The bark is ready and the wind at help,	
The basest jewel will be well esteemed:	
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	
The basin that receives your guilty blood.	
The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;	
The beachy girdle of the ocean	
The bell then beating one-	
The best I had, a princess wrought it me-	
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.       [Flourish]	
The blood I drop is rather physical	
The bloody office of his timeless end.	
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.	
The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush	
The boy gives warning something doth approach.	
The bragging Spaniard.	
The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure	
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,	
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.	
The circle of my glory.	
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,	
The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.	
The common stroke of war.	
The continent and summary of my fortune.	
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,	
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady-	
The country near Dunsinane. Drum and colors.	
The course of true love never did run smooth;	
The crest of youth against your dignity.	
The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.	
The cur is excellent at faults.	
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.	
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.	
The dark and vicious place where thee he got	
The dead with charity enclos'd in clay-	
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,	
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.	
The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw,	
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind	
The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK	
The duty of the day. She looks us like	
The earth can have but earth, which is his due,	
The envious barking of your saucy tongue	
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth	
The evil that men do lives after them,	
The execution of my big-swol'n heart	
The fall of Antony.	
The fashion- less without and more within.              Exit	
The fault's your own.	
The favours of these men. Were they not mine?	
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree	
The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,	
The first that ever touch'd him- he was carried	
The first-begotten and the lawful heir	
The flattering index of a direful pageant,	
The forest	
The forest	
The founder of this law and female bar.	
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,	
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads	
The general suit of Rome; never admitted	
The genius and the mortal instruments	
The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;	
The glowworm shows the matin to be near	
The gods today stand friendly that we may,	
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and	
The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,	
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,	
The gravity and stillness of your youth	
The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin.	
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,	
The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,	
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who	
The history of all her secret thoughts.	
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,	
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,	
The honour of my child.	
The honourable board of council out,	
The husbandry and manage of my house	
The icy precepts of respect, but followed	
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,	
The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham,	
The inclining Desdemona to subdue	
The insolence of office, and the spurns	
The instant burst of clamour that she made	
The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.	
The jaws of darkness do devour it up;	
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier	
The knife that made it.	
The ladies did change favours; and then we,	
The lamentable change is from the best;	
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.	
The law I bear no malice for my death:	
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,	
The leading of thine own revenges, take	
The least of these unspeakable deserts,	
The least of you shall share his part thereof.	
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;	
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,	
The liberal opposition of our spirits,	
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I	
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.	
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf	
The lists, and full proportions are all made	
The living record of your memory.	
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men	
The lustful Edward's title buried-	
The man I am.	
The mart	
The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,	
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle	
The means that makes us strangers!	
The memory be green, and that it us befitted	
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear	
The midwife and the nurse well made away,	
The misplac'd John should entertain an hour,	
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.	
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.	
The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted	
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,	
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,	
The name of Antony; it was divided	
The nature of an insurrection.	
The nearer bloody.	
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided	
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.	
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck	
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,	
The oldest have borne most; we that are young	
The one the other poisoned for my sake,	
The palace	
The park	
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,	
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies	
The pine, and let thee out.	
The plot of situation and the model,	
The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you;	
The precious note of it with a base slave,	
The pretty follies that themselves commit,	
The prison	
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;	
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,	
The reasons you allege do more conduce	
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,	
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?	
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;	
The second name of men, obeys his points	
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach	
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,	
The service that you three have done is more	
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye;	
The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun,	
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort,	
The shrinking slaves of winter.	
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.	
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.	
The slave of nature and the son of hell,	
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!	
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune	
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.	
The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls	
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,	
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,	
The spouse of any noble gentleman.	
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never	
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-	
The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,	
The sum of money which I promised	
The sun will set before I shall discharge	
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction	
The sweet and bitter fool	
The thing we sue for.	
The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd.	
The time shall not be many hours of age	
The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,	
The tongues of soothers! but a braver place	
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?	
The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor	
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,	
The true succeeders of each royal house,	
The truest manner'd, such a holy witch	
The tutor and the feeder of my riots.	
The universal landlord.	
The usurper's cursed head. The time is free.	
The utter loss of all the realm of France.	
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.	
The very bottom and the soul of hope,	
The very lifeblood of our enterprise.	
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.	
The very train of her worst wearing gown	
The villain is alive in Titus' house,	
The water which they beat to follow faster,	
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head	
The ways are dangerous.	
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;	
The which my love and some necessity	
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;	
The why is plain as way to parish church:	
The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate	
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd	
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion	
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.	
The woods near the sea-shore. Before TIMON'S cave	
The world will be thy widow and still weep,	
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.	
The worst is death, and death will have his day.	
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst	
Their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright	
Their banners wave again.	
Their cold intent, tenour, and substance, thus:	
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly	
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words	
Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,	
Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure	
Their manners are so apish.	
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,	
Their sons with arts and martial exercises;	
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;	
Their weapons like to lightning came and went:	
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.	
Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand,	
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,	
Then brook abridgment; and your eyes advance,	
Then by your side no bed-room me deny,	
Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)	
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty;	
Then comes, dropping after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself	
Then doth it well appear the Salique law	
Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS	
Then everything includes itself in power,	
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit	
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,	
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	
Then nightly sings the staring owl:	
Then not in Britain must you bide.	
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow	
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,	
Then take thine auld cloak about thee."	
Then they could smile, and fawn upon his debts,	
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,	
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;	
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,	
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine	
Then why should they love Edward more than me?	
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,	
There are yet missing of your company	
There cannot be those numberless offences	
There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,	
There have I made my promise	
There is a Frenchman his companion, one	
There is a change upon you.	
There is a law in each well-order'd nation	
There is a prohibition so divine	
There is no certain princess that appears;	
There is no harm intended to your person,	
There is no more but so: say it is done,	
There is no stir or walking in the streets,	
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell	
There left me and my man, both bound together;	
There let him stand and rave and cry for food.	
There let them bide until we have devis'd	
There lies thy part.                [Strikes her. She falls]	
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil	
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice	
There shalt thou know thy charge. and there receive	
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,	
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,	
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,	
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;	
There will I stay for thee.	
There with fantastic garlands did she come	
There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.	
There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with	
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.	
There's place and means for every man alive.	
There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.	
There's two of you; the devil make a third,	
Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.	
Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;	
Therefore he hates me.	
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his	
Therefore let every man now task his thought	
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;	
Therefore no kiss.	
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,	
Therefore this article is made in vain,	
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:	
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,	
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,	
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness	
Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent	
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,	
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?	
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man	
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways	
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness	
These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe	
These quarrels must be quietly debated.	
These that I bring unto their latest home,	
These thoughts of horror further than you shall	
These well express in thee thy latter spirits.	
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!	
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these	
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke	
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way	
They call false caterpillars and intend their death.	
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,	
They fight. The King being in danger, enter Prince of Wales.	
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for	
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now	
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;	
They march over and go out.  Alarums.  Then enter again, in skirmish,	
They might have Ev'd to bear, and he to taste	
They pass directly before the CARDINAL,	
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker';	
They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever	
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;	
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,	
They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;	
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt	
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;	
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.	
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.	
They wilfully themselves exil'd from light,	
They will by violence tear him from your palace	
They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I	
They'll say 'tis nought; others to hear the city	
Thine, by yea and no- which is as much as to say as	
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,	
Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.	
This England never did, nor never shall,	
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,	
This before all the world do I prefer;	
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.	
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.	
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,	
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house	
This day, in argument upon a case,	
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;	
This flower's force in stirring love.	
This good man-few of you deserve that title-	
This happy breed of men, this little world,	
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy	
This is as't should be. Let me see the County.	
This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!	
This is the last. So we will home to Rome,	
This is the tragic tale of Philomel	
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,	
This lineal honour from me. This from thee	
This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show	
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.	
This man is better than the man he slew,	
This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,	
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,	
This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us	
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come.	
This realm dismantled was	
This reprobate till he were well inclin'd,	
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,	
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy	
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;	
This small inheritance my father left me	
This sorrow that I have by right is yours;	
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,	
This star of England. Fortune made his sword;	
This sway of motion, this commodity,	
This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians	
This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,	
This sword of mine shall give them instant way	
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,	
This thought is as a death which cannot choose	
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,	
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.	
This tongue had not offended so today,	
This tractable obedience is a slave	
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,	
This was an ill beginning of the night.	
This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is	
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel	
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults	
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!	
Those tender limbs of thine to the event	
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;	
Those will I muster up, and thou, son Clarence,	
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,	
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,	
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.	
Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;	
Thou art a most pernicious usurer;	
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke.	
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck	
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,	
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all	
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.	
Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-	
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:	
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight	
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not	
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.	
Thou dost not slumber: see thy two sons' heads,	
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?	
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!	
Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bade welcome,	
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;	
Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face	
Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;	
Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive	
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.	
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.	
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.	
Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full	
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep-die rather; wink'st	
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,	
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.	
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,	
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,	
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:	
Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st	
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!	
Thou should'st desire to die, being miserable.	
Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,	
Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?	
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,	
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose	
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now, methinks,	
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.	
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate	
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give	
Thou thy worldly task hast done,	
Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;	
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk	
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up	
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,	
Though castles topple on their warders' heads,	
Though haply well for you.	
Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught-	
Though in thy store's account I one must be,	
Though they be never so ridiculous,	
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold	
Though they would swear down each particular saint,	
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.	
Though to it self, it only live and die,	
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,	
Though you be therein curious, the least cause	
Though you hear now- too late!- yet now's a time:	
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,	
Three days before; but this from rumour's tongue	
Three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while!	
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,	
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais	
Three thousand times within this three years' space;	
Threw many a northward look to see his father	
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,	
Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.	
Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,	
Through all the world bears Rosalinde.	
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.	
Through your dominions for this enterprise,	
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,	
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,	
Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.	
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:	
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.	
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;	
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore	
Thus plated in habiliments of war;	
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,	
Thus raps you? Are you well?	
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,	
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,	
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods	
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.	
Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies	
Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat	
Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,	
Thy mother's dead.	
Thy nature did commence in sufferance; time	
Thy sheep be in the corn;	
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.	
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,	
Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here's Nestor,	
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,	
Thy spite on mortal flies.	
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows	
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,	
Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy.	
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.	
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone.	
Till Hymen's torch be lighted; but in vain.	
Till I have thank'd you. When dinner's done	
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign.	
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.	
Till all the Andronici be made away.	
Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.	
Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,	
Till his friend sickness hath determin'd me?	
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,	
Till she had kindled France and all the world	
Till that the Duke give order for his burial;	
Till that the nature of your fault be known	
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down	
Till then in patience our proceeding be.	
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,	
Till time and I think meet.	
Till you do live to see a son of mine	
Tired with all these for restful death I cry,	
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;	
To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.	
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,	
To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]	
To York Place, where the feast is held.	
To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;	
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?	
To answer this your charge?	
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,	
To answer us.	
To any in this presence, I desire	
To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire.	
To banish your defenders, till at length	
To be a queen and crown'd with infamy!	
To be a secondary at control,	
To be a speaker free: when I am hence	
To be a warrior and command a camp.	
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,	
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave.	
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	
To be direct and honest is not safe.	
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	
To be exil'd and thrown	
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,	
To be no better than a homely swain;	
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.	
To be our Regent in these parts of France.	
To be the princely bride of such a lord,	
To be the same in thine own act and valor	
To be to thee this night a torchbearer	
To be your servant.	
To beguile many and be beguiled by one.	
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.	
To blot out me and put his own son in.	
To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.	
To build his fortune I will strain a little,	
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.	
To call them woollen vassals, things created	
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,	
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions	
To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,	
To change a master. O, my fortunes have	
To come as humbly as they us'd to creep	
To come in to the cry without more help.	
To come near. [Exit GENTLEMAN] What can be their business	
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes	
To cope malicious censurers, which ever	
To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit	
To credit his own lie-he did believe	
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,	
To cry 'Good joy.' Good joy, my lord and lady!	
To cry, "Hold, hold!"	
To desperation turn my trust and hope,	
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever	
To do you salutation from his master.	
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend	
To doubtful fortunes, sequest'ring from me all	
To ease his breast with panting.	
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind	
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,	
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,	
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit	
To exploit now ripe in my device,	
To fail in the disposing of those chances	
To fall and blast her pride!	
To feast so great a warrior in my house.              Exeunt	
To feast with me and see me at my tent.	
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,	
To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but	
To fetch me trifles, and return again,	
To find the other forth; and by adventuring both	
To find this practice out.	
To find where your true image pictured lies,	
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!	
To follow in a house where twice so many	
To furnish him with an appertinents	
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio	
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit	
To give thee answer of thy just demand.	
To go about my preparation.                             Exit	
To go with us unto the officers.	
To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome	
To grace the gentry of a land remote	
To groan and sweat under the business,	
To have command obey'd.	
To have her love, provided that your fortune	
To have his sight thither and back again.               Exit	
To have it added to the faults of mine,	
To have some conference with your Grace alone.	
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'	
To hear Cominius speak?	
To hear and see the matter.	
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!	
To hear me speak his good now?	
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	
To hear the sea-maid's music.	
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,	
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.	
To heaven.	
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.	
To her whose state is such that cannot choose	
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.	
To his grand sea.	
To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.	
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,	
To keep an adjunct to remember thee	
To kill the King at Oxford.	
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?	
To know the reason of this strange restraint.	
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.	
To lay the blame upon her own despair	
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-	
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd	
To let me be partaker.	
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?	
To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,	
To linger out a purposed overthrow.	
To lose't or give't away were such perdition	
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,	
To make a bastard and a slave of me!	
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?	
To make confession and to be absolv'd.	
To make distinction. Provide this messenger.	
To make divorce of their incorporate league;	
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.	
To make of him a formal man again.	
To many a watchful night! Sleep with it now!	
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued	
To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;	
To match us in comparisons with dirt,	
To me fair friend you never can be old,	
To me, your friend, than any.	
To meet at London London's King in woe.	
To meet her new beloved anywhere;	
To mend the petty present, I will piece	
To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;	
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,	
To my daughters; and tell them both	
To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.	
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?	
To offices of tender courtesy.	
To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,	
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.	
To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.	
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match	
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.	
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall	
To pardon me yet for a night or two;	
To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.	
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,	
To pay your present debts.	
To pluck down justice from your awful bench,	
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.	
To purge this field of, such a hilding foe;	
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,	
To put my father in impatient thoughts	
To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that	
To quench mine honour; they would shame to make me	
To rain a shower of commanded tears,	
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King,	
To raze one title of your honour out.	
To re-salute his country with his tears,	
To royalize his blood I spent mine own.	
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,	
To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;	
To save your brother from the sacrifice;	
To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live;	
To say there is no vice but beggary.	
To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.	
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,	
To see him pass on to the Capitol.	
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!	
To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt	
To see inherited my very wishes,	
To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied	
To see the making of her carcanet,	
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.	
To see us here unarm'd. I have a woman's longing,	
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie	
To send me packing with an host of men.	
To set against me for your merriment.	
To set his sense on the attentive bent,	
To share with me in glory any more.	
To sheath his knife in us. He is attach'd;	
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.	
To show his teeth as white as whales-bone;	
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub	
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,	
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.	
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.	
To sound the purposes of all their hearts,	
To sounds confus'd; behold the threaden sails,	
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,	
To speak my mind, and I will through and through	
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	
To speak with Timon.	
To square for this? Would it offend you, then,	
To stay for me at church, 'twixt twelve and one,	
To stay him from the fall of vanity;	
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,	
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues	
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;	
To such a greeting. Villain am I none.	
To suffer lawful censure for such faults	
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,	
To take in many towns ere almost Rome	
To take upon you what is yours. You may	
To taste of too.	
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?	
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.	
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,	
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.	
To tell this story, that you might excuse	
To tell your Grace, that, having heard by fame	
To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast	
To th' most of men this is a Caliban,	
To th' rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.	
To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly	
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.	
To thee a woman's services are due;	
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.	
To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,	
To them accordingly.	
To think I can be undiscernible,	
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,	
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.	
To this most cruel act, do but despair;	
To those that without heed do plunge into't.	
To thrust the lie unto him.	
To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,	
To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth	
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.	
To unburden all my plots and purposes	
To understand a law; to know the meaning	
To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows	
To us in our election this day	
To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel.	
To visit other places, and come down	
To wayward sickliness and age in him.	
To wear an undeserved dignity.	
To wear our moral state to come with her,	
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,

To what I ask you.	
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you	
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,	
To whom it must be done.	
To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity	
To witness duty, not to show my wit.	
To woo a maid in way of marriage;	
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.	
To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous;	
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,	
To you for gold to pay my legions,	
To young Octavius of the state of things.	
To your best kindness; one of your great knowing	
To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit	
To-day how many would have given their honours	
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest	
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age.	
To-morrow morning to the Council board	
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.	
To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,	
To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest;	
Together have one dust, yet reverence-	
Told of a many thousand warlike French	
Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing,	
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!	
Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,	
Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner	
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd	
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.

Transform us not to women.

Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.	
Trinculo?	
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks;	
Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.	
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;	
Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt	
Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults	
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.	
Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.	
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.           Exit	
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat	
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since	
Twice being by the people chosen censor,	
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,	
Twice treble shame on Angelo,	
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.	
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?	
Two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk	
Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,	
Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet.	
Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?	
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

Unapt to stir at these indignities,	
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,	
Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;	
Under the smile of safety, wounds the world;	
Under the tide of John Mortimer.	
Under the wings of our Protector's grace,	
Under what title shall I woo for thee	
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.	
Unfit to hear moral philosophy.	
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,	
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,	
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear	
Unless his noble mother and his wife,	
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.	
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.	
Unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet	
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun	
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,	
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;	
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,	
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,

Unto that element; but long it could not be	
Unto the brother of your loving bride.	
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject	
Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;	
Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon	
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,	
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard	
Upon a gath'red lily almost withered.	
Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress	
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor	
Upon her great disaster.	
Upon his death?	
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears	
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,	
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,	
Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,	
Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him	
Upon our territories, and have already	
Upon remainder of a dear account	
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,	
Upon the company you overtake?	
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-	
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,	
Upon the heavy middle of the night	
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,	
Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I	
Upon the spot of this enforced cause-	
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,	
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.	
Upon this jump.                                       Exeunt	
Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed	
Urs. Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent

VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him.

VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.	
VIRGILIA. I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my

WARWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,

WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery;	
WARWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,	
WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,	
WARWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!	
WARWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;	
WARWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.	
WARWICK. What good is this to England and himself!

Warwick my son, the comfort of my age,	
Was a deep envious one.	
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.	
Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity	
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.	
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.	
Was ever conduct of. Some oracle	
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd	
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.	
Was it not so?	
Was mutually committed.	
Was never subject long'd to be a King	
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent	
Was that it was for not being such a smile;	
Was to them as a painting. Now this masque	
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;	
Wasted our country, slain our citizens,	
Wave thus to express his disposition,	
We answer others' merits in our name,	
We are again forsworn in will and error.	
We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill	
We are yet but young in deed.                       Exeunt.	
We call a nettle but a nettle, and	
We came aboard.	
We do exhibit to your Majesty.	
We go to use our hands and not our tongues.	
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.	
We have as many friends as enemies.	
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey	
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.	
We let the people know't.	
We may not think the justness of each act	
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,	
We mourn: France smiles. We lose: they daily get-	
We must awake endeavour for defence,	
We must suggest the people in what hatred	
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready	
We rest your hermits.	
We see each grain of gravel-I do know	
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,	
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,	
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.	
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.	
We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.	
We twain will go into his Highness' tent.	
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.	
We will unite the white rose and the red.	
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,	
We'll be before our welcome.	
We'll hear ourselves again.	
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,	
We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but	
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.	
We, at the height, are ready to decline.	
Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,	
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick;	
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.	
Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for	
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!             [Flourish]	
Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?	
Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.	
Well ratified by law and heraldry,	
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;	
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.	
Well, I will back him straight. O esperance!	
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,	
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail

Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.	
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,

Were not erected by their hands from whom	
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier	
Were not you here but even now, disguis'd?	
Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!	
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,	
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,	
Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.

Westminster. Near the Abbey	
What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield	
What boded this but well-forewarning wind	
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?	
What companies are near. Pray you away;	
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?	
What dreadful dole is here!	
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,	
What faults he made before the last, I think	
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!	
What further comes.	
What great ones do the less will prattle of-	
What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove	
What have I brought you to do?	
What he might be: if what he might he is not,	
What heart receives from hence a conquering part,	
What if this mixture do not work at all?	
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,	
What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;	
What is thy name? Discuss.	
What is unsettled in the King.	
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?	
What it is worth embrac'd.	
What like, offensive.	
What man thou art.	
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile	
What never-dying honour hath he got	
What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?	
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,	
What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?	
What propugnation is in one man's valour	
What safe and nicely I might well delay	
What say you to this, sir?	
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?	
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?	
What shall be done? He will not hear till feel.	
What should the people do with these bald tribunes,	
What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself	
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,	
What thou shouldst be; th' occasion speaks thee; and	
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?	
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?	
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light	
What tributaries follow him to Rome	
What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear better?	
What violent hands can she lay on her life?	
What will Berowne say when that he shall hear	
What will ye do?	
What worser place can I beg in your love,	
What would you do?	
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.	
What you would ask me, that I should deny,	
What! to you,	
What's here?  [Reads]  'I have, upon especial cause,	
What's o'clock, Francis?	
What's the matter with thee now?	
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam	
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?	
What, are you gone again? You must be watch'd ere you be made	
What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,	
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!	
What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison,	
What, was it you that would be England's king?	
What, will he come?	
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,	
When I against my self with thee partake?	
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.	
When I behold the violet past prime,	
When I have most need to employ a friend	
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	
When I have seen such interchange of State,	
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	
When I was but your sister: I you brothers,	
When I was got, Sir Robert was away!	
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,	
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?	
When all our offices have been oppress'd	
When all that is within him does condemn	
When all the breathers of this world are dead,	
When all the world is here to look on me?	
When but in all I was six thousand strong,	
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce	
When first I did embrace him; yet his nature	
When great things labouring perish in their birth.	
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,	
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-	
When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,	
When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit	
When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;	
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him	
When holy and devout religious men	
When in your motion you are hot and dry-	
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks	
When it is bak'd with frost.	
When it is least expected.	
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,	
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!	
When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.	
When mistresses from common sense are hid;	
When no man was his own.	
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,	
When one but of my ordinance stood up	
When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us	
When right with right wars who shall be most right!	
When she did starve the general world beside	
When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,	
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;	
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit	
When think you that the sword goes up again?	
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.	
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend	
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better	
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear.	
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:	
When we shall hap to give't them.	
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,	
When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang	
When yond same star that's westward from the pole	
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh-	
When you have given good morning to your mistress,	
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,	
When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!	
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-	
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.	
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,	
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.	
Where are you there, Sir John? Nay, fear not, man,	
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,	
Where be these warders that they wait not here?	
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,	
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.	
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?	
Where gold; and no man that hath a name	
Where have you left the money that I gave you?	
Where he bestows himself?	
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.	
Where he shall answer by a lawful form,	
Where he was to begin, and give away	
Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,	
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands	
Where is Malvolio?	
Where is he	
Where is he?	
Where is my Lord of Warwick?	
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.	
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?	
Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.	
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.	
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot	
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! Out of my sight!	
Where money is; and I no question make	
Where my poor young was lim'd, was caught, and kill'd.	
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?	
Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife	
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me	
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.	
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?	
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,	
Where th' are extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate	
Where there's another man. The vows of women	
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time	
Where thou thyself dost air-the Queen o' th' sky,	
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?	
Where we do reign we will alone uphold,	
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.	
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,	
Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes	
Where't should be branded, if that right were right,	
Where, meeting with an old religious man,	
Whereby they live. And though that all at once	
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had	
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.	
Wherein you're happy- which will make him know	
Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,	
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime	
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,	
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd	
Whether I in any just term am affined	
Whether I live or die, be you the sons	
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,	
Whether our daughter were legitimate,	
Which God shall guard; and put the world's whole strength	
Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,	
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy	
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.	
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;	
Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.	
Which all men speak with him.	
Which aptly sings the good.	
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.	
Which art my nearest and dearest enemy'	
Which being shallow, you shall give me leave	
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,	
Which break themselves in swearing!	
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,	
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail	
Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!	
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This	
Which do but what they should, by doing everything	
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.	
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.	
Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it:	
Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd	
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,	
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.	
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,	
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does	
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast	
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,	
Which is both healthful and good husbandry.	
Which is it, girl, of these?- Open them, boy.-	
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?	
Which is the ladder of all high designs,	
Which labouring for invention bear amis	
Which likes me better than to wish us one.	
Which made me down to throw my books, and fly-	
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,	
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;	
Which now goes too free-footed.	
Which out of daily fortune ever taints	
Which parti-coated presence of loose love	
Which pierces so that it assaults	
Which seems a little fouler than it is,	
Which shall be most my glory being dumb,	
Which shines here in the west.	
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.	
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet	
Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.	
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent	
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch	
Which swims against your stream of quality.	
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,	
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.	
Which throes thee much to yield.	
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?	
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,	
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,	
Which way they went.	
Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride	
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,	
Which would be so much the more dangerous	
Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?	
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace	
Which you say live to come in my behalf.	
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter	
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,	
Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey	
Which, if convenience will not allow,	
Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion	
Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.	
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.	
While comments of your praise richly compiled,	
While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.	
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.	
While it doth study to have what it would,	
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	
While these do labour for their own preferment,	
While you have throats to answer. For myself,	
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,	
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the	
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.	
Whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold	
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,	
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest	
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,	
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace	
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament	
Whilst I propose the self-same words to the	
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars	
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,	
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.	
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,	
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.	
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.	
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,	
Who being accus'd a crafty murderer,	
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!	
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?	
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,	
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.	
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning	
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;	
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.	
Who hath, for four or five removes, come short	
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,	
Who is so far from Italy removed	
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.	
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate	
Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King	
Who should against his murtherer shut the door,	
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file	
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?	
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.	
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,	
Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever	
Who to Philippi here consorted us.	
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.	
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,	
Who's here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?	
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,	
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,	
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,	
Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury,	
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,	
Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time	
Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,	
Whom I do love and will do till my death.	
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,	
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,	
Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,	
Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,	
Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,	
Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but	
Whom once more I present unto your Highness.	
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue	
Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,	
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	
Whom we have left protectors of the King,	
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof,	
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	
Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;	
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.       Exit	
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath	
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.	
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March	
Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithee	
Whose execution takes your enemy off,	
Whose face I never saw?	
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.	
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth	
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?	
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,	
Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,	
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.	
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine-	
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,	
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;	
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,	
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,	
Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?	
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,	
Why at this time the doors are made against you.	
Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me	
Why do you send so thick?	
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?	
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;	
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?	
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	
Why seems it so particular with thee?

Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;	
Why stands he so perplex'd?	
Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn'd on him?

Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.	
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'	
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,	
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;	
Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?	
Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.	
Why, then she lives.	
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!	
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!

You do unbend your noble strength, to think	
You found his mote; the King your mote did see;	
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;	
You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.	
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.	
You have won a happy victory to Rome;	
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?	
You knew my father well, and in him me,	
You know your mother means to feast with me,	
You know your places. God be with you all!
