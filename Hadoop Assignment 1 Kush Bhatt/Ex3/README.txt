Two tests were performed for this exercise:

1. Simply using the shakespeare.txt file (Not a great example because it is only one file).

2. The second test involved splitting shakespeare.txt (roughly equally) into 5 txt files (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5) and performing the mapreduce on the directory
   containing these 5 files.   <--- I WILL BE DEMO-ING THIS.
